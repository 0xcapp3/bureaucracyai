La Collana “Consumatori e mercato”, per le Edizioni Universitarie di
Roma Tre all’ interno del progetto di Ateneo Roma TrE-Press, intende essere
una piattaforma editoriale multilingue, avente ad oggetto studi attinenti
alla tutela dei consumatori e alla regolazione del mercato. Lintento
é di stimolare un proficuo scambio scientifico attraverso una diretta
partecipazione di studiosi appartenenti a diverse discipline, tradizioni e
generazioni. I] dialogo multidisciplinare e multiculturale diviene infatti
una componente indefettibile nell’ambito di una materia caratterizzata
da un assetto disciplinare ormai maturo tanto nelle prassi applicative
del mercato quanto nel diritto vivente. Lattenzione viene in particolare
rivolta al contesto del diritto europeo, matrice delle scelte legislative e
regolamentari degli ordinamenti interni, e allo svolgimento dell’analisi
su piani differenti (per estrazione scientifica e punti di osservazione) che
diano conto della complessita ordinamentale attuale.

The “Consumer and market” series edited by Edizioni Universitarie
di Roma Tre for the Roma TrE-Press project, aims at being a multilingual
editorial project, which shall focus on consumer protection and market
regulation studies. The series’ core mission is the promotion of a fruitful
scientific exchange amongst scholars from diverse legal systems, traditions
and generations. [his multidisciplinary and multicultural exchange has in
fact become fundamental for a mature legal framework, from both the
market practice and the law in action standpoints. A particular focus will be
given on European law, where one can find the roots of the legislation and
regulation in the domestic legal systems, and on the analysis of different
levels, in line with the current complexity of this legal sector.

1. Introduction

The Internal Market (in the terminology currently used in Art. 3(3)
TEU and Art. 26 of the TFEU) has always been the core of the European
integration process representing the essential element of European integration
since its inception.

Today, the establishment of the Internal Market finds its legal basis in
Art. 3 TEU, upon which the EU sets its aims and goals.

Article 3 TEU
[...]

3. The Union shall establish an internal market. It shall work
for the sustainable development of Europe based on balanced
economic growth and price stability, a highly competitive
social market economy, aiming at full employment and social
progress, and a high level of protection and improvement of
the quality of the environment. It shall promote scientific
and technological advance.

It shall combat social exclusion and discrimination, and
shall promote social justice and protection, equality between
R. Torino

women and men, solidarity between generations and
protection of the rights of the child.

It shall promote economic, social and territorial cohesion,
and solidarity among Member States.

It shall respect its rich cultural and linguistic diversity, and
shall ensure that Europe’s cultural heritage is safeguarded
and enhanced.

[...]

Art. 3 TEU refers to the Internal Market in its third paragraph after the
first paragraph has identified the promotion of peace, its values (as set in
Art. 2 TUE) and the well-being of the peoples of the European Union as
the priority aims of the Union. The second paragraph refers to the area of
freedom, security and justice that the European Union offers to its citizens.

The apparent downshifting (with respect to the original version of the
EEC Treaty) of the Internal Market in the hypothetical scale of the EU’s
goals and tasks as set by the current version of Article 3 TUE must be
assessed in the context of rebalancing of the policy bases of the European
integration process.

Since the establishment of the European Union (after the Maastricht
Treaty) - and partially as a response to the crisis of confidence concerning its
worthiness — the European integration process has been oriented towards
a wider political view. New policies and regulations have tried to highlight
the common political and civil values of the integration process, with
particular attention to the life conditions and needs of European citizens,
who are no longer regarded as mere market operators (such as workers,
entrepreneurs or professionals or consumers).

In this context, the establishment and the improvement of the proper
functioning of the Internal Market processes are deemed today one of
the two main lines of the future of the European integration process
development, not uniquely directed to the integration of Member States’
economies, but enriched by sharing, respect and promotion of the values

set by Article 2 TEU.

Article 2 TEU

The Union is founded on the values of respect for human
dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect
for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to
THE INTERNAL MARKET

minorities. These values are common to the Member States in
a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance,
justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail.

Moreover, Art. 7 TFEU states that the European Union shall ensure
consistency between its policies and actions, and Articles from 8 to
12 TFEU provide that in any policy or action (and, therefore, also in
building up and improving the functioning of the Internal Market), the
European Union pursues the objectives of anti-discrimination (Art. 10),
social policy (Art. 9), environmental protection (Art. 11) and consumer
protection (Art. 12).

It should also be noted that Art. 114 TFEU states that in pursuing the
aim of establishing and ensuring the functioning of the Internal Market both
the European Commission and Member States (the latter when put in place
measures which derogate from the harmonization directives issued by European
institutions) have to or may have to give due consideration to the health and
safety of citizens, consumer protection and environmental protection.

The future of the Internal Market is played today, therefore, in its capacity
to be a coherent instrument with the new political phase of the European
integration process. The concept of the Internal Market evoluted. The
Internal Market was born as an expression of the synthesis of an area without
internal frontiers in which the four economic fundamental freedoms are
guaranteed (the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital). Today
the Internal market appears to have much broader scope, watching the entire
structure of relations, not only purely economic, between market actors, and
therefore open to consider and to take on the values shared by the actors in the
market, which are, once again, the protection of consumers, environmental
protection, respect for human rights (primarily workers), gender equality,
cohesion between generations.

In this respect, the four fundamental economic freedoms - though still
constitute the core of the Internal Market and that, therefore, will hereafter
be individually examined (because, notwithstanding a convergence process
between them, there still are divergences among them and they cannot be
treated alike) - are mere elements of an “alphabet” of a much broader discourse.

The four fundamental economic freedoms are articulated and declined
daily in multiple sectoral policies of the European Union (each of which
would deserve discussion in its own and that are influenced and influence
the concrete realization of the Internal market), by European institutions
and national authorities, cross-borders businesses and European consumers
R. Torino

The four fundamental economic freedoms are a core part of the
European multi-level legal system, according to the teleological profiles of
the Internal Market outlined by Art. 3 TEU and in a day-by-day dialogue
with European citizenship and the fundamental rights recognised at
European level (first of all by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the

European Union).

2. Historical evolution: from the Common Market to the Internal Market

In 1951 the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty was signed.
This first treaty established a successful common control over the coal
and steel market among the six founding countries (Belgium, France,
West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) and suppressed
the customs duties and quantitative restrictions on these goods, as well as
all discriminatory measures, aids or subsidies which were granted by such
Member States to their domestic production of coal and steel.

In 1957 the same Member States decided to deepen their economic
integration through the establishment of a ‘Common Market’ in the terms
and in the manner established by the EEC Treaty.

Ina political context in which predominated the Ricardian economic vision
of comparative advantage theory and of the importance of free trade between
states - as well as the ordoliberal theory - economic growth and efficiency gains
were considered inevitable economic advantages of uniting national markets
into a common market resulting from a greater division of labour between
Member States and the exploitation of comparative advantages.

It was provided that the Common Market was to be implemented
in stages over a transitional period of twelve years (to be completed by
December 31, 1969).

In order to establish a free movement of products, Art. 3 EEC Treaty
provided first of all the establishment of a customs union with regard to the
movement of goods, with complete abolition of customs tariffs between
Member States (now see Art. 28(1) TFEU), the elimination of quantitative
restrictions on the import and export of goods, and of all measures having
equivalent effect (now Articles 34 and 35 TFUE), and the adoption of a
common customs tariff (CCT’) in respect to third countries.

The Common Market was completed, since its origin, by provisions
allowing the free movement of production factors, i.e. the free movement
THE INTERNAL MARKET

of workers and capital (based on the idea that liberalization of factors
of production allows for the optimum allocation of labour and capital),
as well as the free movement of services. In addition, common policies
in agriculture and transport, an effective regime of free competition
(prohibiting anticompetitive behaviour of private actors that might attempt
to resurrect barriers to trade on national lines as well as State aids) and the
coordination of economic policies were established.

In other words, the Common Market was well beyond a free trade area
(ie. an area where a group of States abolishes, between themselves, tariffs
and quantitative restrictions to inter-State trade but have different external
policies) or a custom union (z.e. an area combining a free trade area with a
common customs policy towards the outside world). The Internal Market was
envisaged to be not only an economic ‘bloc’ toward third countries but also an
area without internal frontiers allowing the free movement of goods, persons,
services and capital, eliminating nationalist ‘protectionism’ among Member
States. The material goal of the Internal Market was and is the elimination of
all obstacles to intra-Union trade in order to merge the national markets into
a single market bringing about conditions as close as possible to those of a
genuine internal-domestic market (see Gaston Schul, case 15/81).

Despite the complete realization of the customs union in 1968, the
progress was much slower with respect to the removal of barriers and nontariff restrictions on the free movement of goods between Member States.
The presence of such obstacles and constraints was often generated by the
persistence in the legal systems of the Member States of different technical
standards (concerning, for example, the security requirements of the products
or packaging of the same product), differentiated regulations relating
to transport sector, non-transparent procedures for public procurement,
administrative and bureaucratic obstacles, disparate tax treatments. The
situation was not better in relation to the free movement of persons, services
and capital, with respect to which there were also obstacles, constraints and
national resistance.

In the eighties of the twentieth century, the European Commission
(headed by its President Jacques Delors) launched, therefore, several
studies and initiatives directed to investigate the reasons and the negative
economic effects (the so-called ‘cost of non-Europe’) of the slowdown in
the establishment of the Common Market process.

In June 1985, on the occasion of the Milan European Council was
presented by the European Commission a white paper on completion
of the Internal Market by 1992, containing illustration of hundreds of
R. Torino

measures (the White Paper set out a timetable for the enactment of circa
300 measures) considered necessary for the removal of physical barriers
(ze. customs posts at frontiers and corresponding formalities), technical
barriers (z.e. different regulatory product standards in Member States) and
fiscal barriers (i.e. differences in indirect taxation, such as excise taxes); still
such measures hindered the full realization of the common market.

The achievement of 1985 White Paper goals was facilitated at political
level by the adoption of the Single European Act 1986 (‘SEA’), by which,
in order to advance in the establishment of the Common Market (in such
document called ‘Internal Market’), was introduced for the Council the
qualified majority voting system for decisions on the internal market (the
new Article 100A EEC, now Article 114 TFUE which refers to the s.c.
ordinary legislative procedure). Since then, this new method of voting
(thanks to which a single Member State could no longer block decisions
on Internal Market) would have facilitated the adoption of measures of
harmonization of national legislation and the elimination of administrative
and regulatory obstacles to trade between Member States.

Article 114 TEU

1. Save where otherwise provided in the Treaties, the following
provisions shall apply for the achievement of the objectives set
out in Article 26. The European Parliament and the Council
shall, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative
procedure and after consulting the Economic and Social
Committee, adopt the measures for the approximation of
the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative
action in Member States which have as their object the
establishment and functioning of the internal market.

2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply to fiscal provisions, to those
relating to the free movement of persons nor to those relating
to the rights and interests of employed persons.

It deserves to be noted that the SEA adopted for the internal market
the current definition, which states clearly that the Internal Market is an
area without internal frontiers with free movement of goods, persons,
services and capital.

Thanks to the SEA the European Economic Community adopted by
31 December 1992 nearly three hundred regulatory measures to facilitate
THE INTERNAL MARKET

completion of the opening of national markets in view of the full establishment of the Internal Market, following two main ways of intervention:

a) introduction of several common European standards replacing
the different (then twelve) existing national regulations (socalled ‘approximation of laws’ or ‘harmonization’ process);

b) application of the ‘principle of mutual recognition’ in each Member State of the laws and regulations in force in other Member
States so that the product standards would not necessarily have
to be harmonized before products could be traded in the territory of the Member States (z.e., if a product is lawfully manufactured and marketed in one Member State, there is no reason why
it should not be sold freely throughout the Community).

As of January 1, 1993, they were then tangibly less even trade barriers
in relation to the movement of goods.

The economic crisis of the end of the first decade of the twenty-first
century also led the European institutions to re-verify the effectiveness of the
functioning of the Internal Market, in relation to new closing nationalistic
attempts of Member States’ markets and economic sectors, where the
principles of the Internal Market did not appear to have been fully met yet,
resulting in the recruitment of a number of initiatives to further develop it.

After the Lisbon Treaty (2007) the legal basis of the establishment of
the Internal Market can be found in Articles 26 and 27 TFEU.

Article 26
1. The Union shall adopt measures with the aim of establishing
or ensuring the functioning of the internal market, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Treaties.

2. The internal market shall comprise an area without
internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods,
persons, services and capital is ensured in accordance with
the provisions of the Treaties.

3. The Council, on a proposal from the Commission, shall
determine the guidelines and conditions necessary to ensure
balanced progress in all the sectors concerned.

On the invitation of the President of the EU Commission, on 9 May
2010, Mr. Mario Monti delivered a report (A New Strategy for the Single
Market) aimed at re-launching the Single Market.

On the basis of the s.c. ‘Monti Report’ and after the holding of a
R. Torino

public consultation between late 2010 and early 2011, the European
Commission published two communications:

i) ‘The act for the single market. Twelve levers to boost growth and
strengthen confidence. Working together to create new growth in

April 2011 (COM (2011) 206 final);

ii) “The Single Market Act II. Working together to create new growth
in October 2012 (COM (2012) 573 final).

In those communications - under the Europe 2020 Strategy, ‘A
strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth (COM (2010) 2020)
- the European Commission has drawn its lines of action to increase the
confidence of businesses and citizens in the Internal Market and economic
and employment development opportunities for growth resulting from its
full realization.

Latest developments on the strategy and future steps and actions related
to the establishment and improvement of the Internal Market have been
set in the European Commission’s communication ‘Upgrading the Single
Market: more opportunities for people and business (COM (2015) 550 final)

All the above historical steps in the establishment of the Internal
Market confirm that creating a genuine integrated market is not a finite
task, but rather an ongoing process, requiring constant effort, vigilance,
and updating, because never-ending technological developments and everchanging political attitudes in Member States (always trapped between
protectionist attitude and an effective European spirit) result in a global
context in which the single market functions are changing all the time.

Many obstacles toward a “perfect” (genuinely domestic) Internal
Market have been removed, but new obstacles daily appear and need to be
addressed, in a day-by-day process involving Member State and European
institutions, public entities and private citizens and enterprises.

3. Establishment of the Internal Market

The establishment of the Internal Market is a shared competence

between the Union and the Member States, as provided by Art. 4(2) TFUE.
THE INTERNAL MARKET

Article 4 TFEU

2. Shared competence between the Union and the Member

States applies in the following principal areas:

(a) internal market;

[...]

Art. 2(2) TFUE regulates the exercise of the shared competences by
the European Union and the Member States.

Article 2 TFEU

2. When the Treaties confer on the Union a competence
shared with the Member States in a specific area, the Union
and the Member States may legislate and adopt legally
binding acts in that area. The member States shall exercise
their competence to the extent that the Union has not
exercised its competence. The Member States shall again
exercise their competence to the extent that the Union has
decided to cease exercising its competence

[...]

Basically the establishment of the Internal Market has been realized by
EU institutions and it is still realized through several ways:

a) prohibition of discriminations;
b) approximation of national regulations;

c) harmonization of technical standards.

All the above “methods” or “ways” can be classified into two different
and complementary categories of integration:

a) negative integration

b) positive integration
Negative integration refers to the removal of (no more allowed) national
barriers to the free movement, whereas positive integration results in the
‘harmonisation’ or ‘approximation of national laws and regulations realized
by the EU through its legislative acts (regulations and directives).
R. Torino

At first instance, the European treaties establish that in the Internal
Market there shall not be national barriers to trade in goods and shall be
assured the free movement of workers, services and capital. Of course,
the four economic freedoms apply only to situations that involve a crossborder element and the ECJ has ruled that the freedom provisions are not
applicable to situations which are purely internal to a Member State (see
case Knoors, C-115/78).

The TFEU contains specific constitutional prohibitions negating
illegitimate obstacles to intra-Union trade, z.e.:

i) Articles 30, 34 and 35 with respect to the free trade of goods;
ii) Art. 45 with respect to the free movement for workers;

iii) Art. 49 concerning the freedom of establishment for take up and
pursue economic activities;

iv) Art. 46 with respect to the freedom to provide services;

v) Art. 63 with respect to the free movement of capitals.

These prohibitions have a direct effect as recognised by the EC] in the
renowned case Cassis de Dijon (case 128/78) which introduced the ‘mutual
recognition principle’ with respect to the free movement of goods: a
product legally put on the market or into the jurisdiction of one Member
State should be allowed to circulate freely in the common market unless
mandatory requirements concerning health, fiscal supervision, fairness of
commercial practices, and consumer protection could be invoked by the
receiving Member State.

The ‘negative integration strategy guaranteed by the mutual recognition
principle is complemented by the secondary (but not less important)
positive integration strategy by which the EU adopts positive European
legislation to harmonise diverse national laws. In the TFEU there are several
‘~harmonisation’ competences conferred to the EU, among which the most
famous and useful is the provision of the above mentioned Art. 114 TFUE.

The principle of subsidiarity is applicable in areas which do not fall
within EU exclusive competence, as the Internal Market. This principle
aims to ensure that decisions are taken as close as possible to the citizen and
that constant checks are made to verify that action at EU level is justified
in the light of the possibilities available at national, regional or local level.

10
THE INTERNAL MARKET

Article 3 TFEU

[...]
3. Under the principle of subsidiarity, in areas which do

not fall within its exclusive competence, the Union shall act
only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action
cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, either
at central level or at regional and local level, but can rather, by
reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better
achieved at Union level

Institutions of the Union shall apply the principle of
subsidiarity as laid down in the Protocol on the application
of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. National
Parliaments ensure compliance with the principle of
subsidiarity in accordance with the procedure set out in that
Protocol.

[...]

Pursuant to the principle of subsidiarity, the EU does not take action,
unless it is more effective than action taken at national, regional or local
level. It is closely bound up with the principle of proportionality, requiring
that any action by the EU should not go beyond what is necessary to achieve
the objectives of the Treaties.

Two Protocols annexed to the Treaty of Lisbon are fundamental with
respect to the application of the principle of subsidiarity:

a)

b)

Protocol n. 1 on the role of national Parliaments encourages
national Parliaments’ involvement in EU activities and requires
EU documents and proposals to be forwarded promptly to them,
so they can examine them before the Council takes a decision.

Protocol n. 2 requires the Commission to take into account the
regional and local dimension of all draft legislative acts and to
make a detailed statement on how the principle of subsidiarity is
respected. This Protocol allows national Parliaments to object to a
proposal on the grounds that it breaches the principle, as a result
of which the proposal must be reviewed and may be maintained,
amended or withdrawn by the Commission, or blocked by the
European Parliament or the Council.

3.1 Prohibition of discriminations and restrictive measures

The effective implementation and respect of the four economic
freedoms require that all direct and indirect discriminations on the ground
of nationality are prohibited.

Direct discriminations are deemed as laws, rules and practices that
explicitly put nationals (or products manufactured in other Member
States) at disadvantage on the ground of their nationality or origin. The
EC] holds steadily that the four economic freedoms require the full
respect of the principle of equal treatment which means that comparable
situations should not be treated differently and that different situations
should not be treated in the same way, unless such treatment is objectively
justified (see Nancy Delay, case C-276/07).

Indirect discriminations (restrictive measures) are considered laws, rules
and practices that apply indistinctly to nationals and non-nationals (or
products manufactured in other Member States) but create detrimental
effects mainly for non-nationals. The ECJ ruled that a national provision
shall be deemed as indirectly discriminatory if it is intrinsically liable to affect
non-nationals more than nationals and if there is a consequent risk that it
will place the former at a disadvantage (see Hartmann, case C-212/05).

The leading case of this broad interpretation is the Dassonville case
(case C-8/74) in which the EC] held that Article 34 TFUE prohibits all
trading rules enacted by a Member State which are capable of hindering,
directly or indirectly, actually or potentially, intracommunity trade.

After the judgment in Dassonville, the European judges applied this
broad interpretation also with respect to the other freedoms: in Sager (case
C-76/90) for services, Bosman (case C-415/93) for workers and Gebhard
(case C-55/94) for establishment.

The obligation not to discriminate applies to the institutions of
central governments as well as to the institution of regional or local public
authorities (see Stopover Tax, case C-169/08).

3.2 Justifications for discriminations or restrictive measures

Under specific circumstances discriminatory and/or restrictive measures
can be justified.

The TFEU explicitly recognizes that public policy, public security, and
public health can justify the adoption of discriminatory and/or restrictive

12
THE INTERNAL MARKET

measures by Member States.

In particular:

a) Art. 36 TFEU provides that discriminatory and/or restrictive
measures applicable to the free movement of goods can be justified
on the grounds of public morality, public policy or public security,
the protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants,
the protection of national treasures possessing artistic, historic
or archaeological value, and the protection of industrial and
commercial property;

b) with respect to free movement of workers, right of establishment
and free movement of services discriminatory and/or restrictive
measures are justified on the grounds of public policy, public
security and public health as well as in case of measures concerning
activities connected with the exercise of official authority (Art. 51
TFEU for the right of establishment) and the employment in the
public service (Art. 45 TFEU for workers);

c) with respect to the free movement of capital discriminatory and/
or restrictive measures can be justified on grounds of public policy
or public security, as well as certain restrictions with regard to
taxation and to capital movement to and from third countries.

There is a settled EC] case law according to which measures that are
directly discriminatory can be justified only on the basis of the exceptions
expressly stated by the Treaty (see Access to Museums, case C-388/01, and
Temp Work Agencies, case C-490/04).

Moreover, the EC] recognized that such measures can be justified in
consideration of other important regulatory purposes. In the leading case
Cassis de Dijon (1979, 120/78), the European judges ruled that national
measures that constitute restrictions could be justified also on grounds
other than those explicitly mentioned in the Treaty; in particular, in this
case the justification was represented by consumer protection.

Since then the EC] has accepted that indirectly discriminatory and
indistinctly applicable restrictive measures can be justified on the grounds
of environmental protection (see Beer Bottles, case 302/86), protection of
fundamental rights (see Schmidberger, case C-112/00), protection of workers
(see Arblade, case C-369/96 and C-376/96), protection of media plurality
(see United Pan-Europe Communications, case C-250/06), road safety (see
Italian Trailers, case C-110/05), defence and promotion of one or several

13
R. Torino

of the official languages of a Member State (see UTECA, case C-222-07).

The list of public interests that can justify indirectly discriminatory
and indistinctly applicable restrictive measures is deemed not-exhaustive
and the Member States can decide which level of protection they wish to
grant, but this possibility is subject to certain limitations: Member States
cannot apply a protective standard that exceeds the standards set by EU
law if the area is fully harmonized (on the contrary, if the area is subject
only to a minimum harmonization, Member States can enforce higher
protection standards).

It has to be underlined that ECJ does not accept justifications that
serve purely economic goals (see Campus Oil, case 72/83), such as the
protection of domestic businesses (see case Finalarte, case C-49/98 and
other joined cases).

In order to be justified, all discriminatory and/or restrictive national
measures shall in any case be ‘proportionate’ and the task of each Member
State is to provide evidence of such ‘proportionality’. With respect to such
burden of the proof, the ECJ has established that it is true that it is for a
Member State which involves an imperative requirement as justification for
the hindrance to free movement (of goods, in such case) to demonstrate that
its rules are appropriate and necessary to attain the legitimate objective
being pursued. Anyway, such burden of proof cannot be so extensive as to
require a Member State to positively prove that no other conceivable measure
could enable that objective to be attained under the same condition (see
case Italian Trailers, case C-110/05). In fact, all Member States have the
power to set the degree of protection that they wish to recognize to a public
interest goal and how that degree of protection is to be achieved (see Blanco

Perez, case C-570/07 and C-571/07).

A discriminatory and/or restrictive national measure can be deemed
‘proportionate’ if the following requirements are respected:

a) ‘appropriateness’ or ‘suitability’: the discriminatory and/or
restrictive national measure must be appropriate in order to achieve
the purported regulatory goal (see Stopover Tax, case C-169/08)
and the national legislation must pursue the goal in a consistent
and systematic manner (see Hartlauer, case C-169-07);

b) ‘necessity’: the discriminatory and/or restrictive national measure
must not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the goal.
If a less restrictive measure is available to attain the same objective,
this means that the proposed national measure has failed the

14
THE INTERNAL MARKET

proportionality test (see Solgar Vitamins, case C-446/08).
3.3 Approximation of national regulations

Pursuant to Art. 114 TFEU, the European Parliament and the Council,
on the basis of the ordinary legislative procedure, and after consultation of
the Economic and Social Committee shall carry out the objectives set out
in Art. 26 TFEU (the establishment of an area without internal frontiers
where the free movement of goods, people, services and capital). The
achievement of such objectives shall be guaranteed through the adoption
of measures of approximation (harmonization) of the laws, regulations and
administrative provisions of the Member States, which have as their purpose
the establishment and functioning of the Internal market.

Article 114 TEU

1. Save where otherwise provided in the Treaties, the following
provisions shall apply for the achievement of the objectives set
out in Article 26. The European Parliament and the Council
shall, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative
procedure and after consulting the Economic and Social
Committee, adopt the measures for the approximation of
the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative
action in Member States which have as their object the
establishment and functioning of the internal market.

[...]

Pursuant to Art. 115 TFEU tax provisions, free movement of persons
and regulatory measures concerning rights and interests of employees
require to be adopted through the special legislative procedure by the
Council, acting unanimously after having consulted both the European
Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee.

Article 114 TEU

[...]

2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply to fiscal provisions, to those
relating to the free movement of persons nor to those relating
to the rights and interests of employed persons.

In the judgment given in the famous case concerning the Directive on
advertising of tobacco products (also known as The Tobacco Advertising
I, case C-376/98) the EC] annulled the Directive 98/43/EC relating to
the advertising and sponsorship products tobacco default of the appropriate legal basis thereof and specified the scope of Art. 114 TFEU (further
confirmed and delineated in Tobacco Advertising II, case C-380/03, and
Swedish Match, case C-210/03), ruling that:

a) harmonization measures taken on the basis of Art. 114 TFUE must
contribute to removing the barriers to trade between Member States
or distortions to free competition;

b) although there is not a materiality threshold (de minimis) of the
aforementioned either obstacles and distortions, the harmonization
is only possible in order to remove obstacles or distortions
‘appreciable’ (because, otherwise, a broad interpretation of art. 114
TFEU would give to the European Union unlimited power of
harmonization and that will be contrary to the principle according
to which only certain European Union competences are conferred);

c) although it is acceptable that the harmonization prevents the
establishment of barriers and distortions, the latter must be probable,
not merely theoretical.

Another question of interpretation settled by the EC) in relation to
Art. 114 TFEU concerned the possibility of using this article not only for
the purpose of direct introduction of harmonization measures, but also for
the creation of mechanisms or systems aimed at the latter purpose. That
possibility allowing a broader scope of Art. 114 TFEU has been positively
recognized by European judges in judicial decisions given in the proceedings
Smoke flavorings (case C-66/04) and ENISA (case C-217/04).

It is also settled case-law that, although recourse to art. 114 TFEU as a
legal basis is possible if the aim is to prevent the emergence of future obstacles
to trade as a result of divergences in national laws, the emergence of such
obstacles must be likely and the measure in question must be designed to
prevent them (judgments in British American Tobacco (Investments) and
Imperial Tobacco, case C-491/01, Arnold André, case C434/02, Swedish
Match, case C210/03, Germany v Parliament and Council, case C380/03,
and Vodafone and Others, case C-58/08).

In the approximation of national regulations, art. 114 TFEU confers
to the EU legislature a discretion (see Philip Morris, case C-547/14),

depending on the general context and the specific circumstances of the

16
THE INTERNAL MARKET

matter to be harmonised, as regards the method of approximation most
appropriate for achieving the desired result, in particular in fields with
complex technical features (judgments in Tobacco Advertising IT, case
C380/03, and United Kingdom v Parliament and Council, case C-270/12).

It was thus open to the EU legislature, in the exercise of that discretion, to
proceed towards harmonisation only in stages and to require only the gradual
abolition of unilateral measures adopted by the Member States (judgment in
Rewe-Zentral, case 37/83).

In fact, the approximation of the national regulations is performed
applying two main kind of harmonisation:

a) a minimum’ harmonisation: in this case, the European legislation
sets a minimal threshold (a set of minimum common rules) that
national legislation must meet; however, national laws may exceed
(implementing stricter rules for whoever shall observe such rules)
the terms of the European legislation if desired;

b) a‘maximum’ or ‘full’ harmonisation: in this case, the European
legislation sets rules that national laws may not exceed (Member
States cannot either retain or introduce stricter or weaker rules
for whoever shall observe such rules).

Currently, civca 80% of the provisions aimed at establishing or improving
the Internal Market are set out through directives, which have the advantage
of flexibility with respect to local preferences and situations and allow
Member States to adapt the approximation of laws to their national legal
systems. But the directives have the downsides represented by the time-lag
between the adoption at EU level and national implementation, and the
risks of non-implementation or gold-plating at national level.

An alternative to the approximation by directives is represented by
the approximation by regulations, which brings the advantages of clarity,
predictability and more effectiveness, establishing a clearer level playing
field for citizens and businesses and carrying a greater potential for private
enforcement. However also regulations are not the “perfect tool”, because
their rigidity can hinder the internal coherence of the national legal systems.

3.4 Indirect effect of directives

Even if not implemented (or wrongly implemented) by Member
States, European directives can have an “indirect” effect useful for the
right implementation of the four economic freedoms which represent the

17
R. Torino

core of the Internal Market.

In the case Von Colson and Kamann (case 14/83), concerning an
European directive that a Member State did not properly implement, the
EC] ruled that the national courts should interpret national laws in line
with the (correct implementation of the) directive, in so far national law
gives discretion to do so.

This case law was confirmed and extended in the cases Marleasing
(C-106/89), where the concerned Member State did not implement the directive at all, Adeneler (C-212/04) and Spedition Welter (C-306/12).

3.5 Harmonization of technical standards

The approximation of laws of the Member States for the completion
of the Internal Market has peculiarities in relation to technical standards
imposed by each Member State for the manufacture of certain categories
of products (from simple products - such as can be toys - to products
with a high degree of technical complexity), whose diversity can severely
obstacle trade between Member States.

In a first phase, which lasted until the mid-eighties of the twentieth
century, also in relation to these technical standards, the European
Community has operated following a mere approximation of laws by means
of the harmonization directives, thereby delaying the full establishment of
the Common Market, particularly if one considers the amount of types of
products offered on the market and their constant evolution.

Then, in 1990, it was introduced the so called ‘New Approach’ in
relation to the standardization of technical rules, on the basis of which the
role played by the harmonization directives is much decreased (confining
most directives to establishing general safety requirements for broad
product categories). In the framework of the New Approach a central role
has been entrusted to the European standardization agencies, including,
for example, the European Committee for standardization (CEN), the
European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation (CENELEC) or
the European Communication standards Institute (ETSI), which quickly
determine, and frequently update, uniform technical standards.

The observance by producers of these uniform technical standards is
voluntary and can be certified by appropriate independent certifying bodies.

The ‘New Approach’ provides that the producers can market only
products that can be considered safe. To this end, manufacturers can
ask to the independent certification bodies (different in each Member

18
THE INTERNAL MARKET

State) to assess the conformity of their products to standardized technical
requirements developed by European standardization agencies.

When an independent certification body assess its conformity, a
certified product acquires a presumption of conformity with respect to the
essential safe requirements required by the European law and can be marked
with ‘CE’ mark. Therefore, such product is allowed to freely circulate, to
be placed on the market and to be used freely within the territory of all
Member States of the European Union (see case Latchways and Eurosafe
Solutions, C-185/08, and case James Elliott, C-613/14). Member States may
not impose additional requirements on certified products for their effective
use on the market and within the territory (see case_ James Elliott, C-613/14).

4. Internal market and individual rights: the principle of direct effect

Today, Art. 26 of the TFUE - pursuant to which the Internal Market
shall comprise an area without internal frontiers in which the free
movements of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured - is interpreted
as a set of individual rights: the right to move goods and capital freely across
borders, to freely provide and receive services, and to access employment or
self-employment in another Member State.

In the seminal case Van Gend en Loos (case C 26/62) and Costa v Enel
(case 6/64), the ECJ established that the above rights can be directly and
immediately invoked by individuals in domestic legal proceedings (even if
the European law either establishing or regulating such rights has not been
transposed in the national legal system or it has been wrongly transposed)
and must be protected by national courts.

Since the development of such case law, national courts are called to
guarantee the enforcement of such rights not only among Member States.

Pursuant to the principle of direct effect, individuals can ask to national
judges to not apply the national rules conflicting with the European rules
and to adjudicate the national case without taking into consideration such
conflicting (and therefore voided) national rules (see Simmmenthal, case
C-106/77).

The principle of direct effect is twofold, because there is a vertical
direct effect and a horizontal direct effect:

a) the vertical direct effect means that individuals can invoke a
European provision with respect to the legal relationships they have

19
R. Torino

with the Member State to whom they belong to;

b) the horizontal direct effect means that an individual can invoke a
European provision with respect to the legal relationships they have
with another individual when they exercise their private autonomy
in establishing and regulating their legal relationship. In this case,
the European law creates subjective rights and obligations between
individuals. Anyway, it shall be observed that the horizontal effect
is recognised only to the primary legislation and regulations, while
directives do not have horizontal direct effect between individuals
(directives can trigger only damage actions by individuals against
any Member State that has not yet or properly implemented the
directive; see cases Francovich, C-6/90, Faccini Dori, C-91/92,
Brasserie du pécheur, C-46/93, Dillenkofer, C-178/94).

It has to be noted that ECJ case law is dichotomist: whereas provisions
on the free movement of workers and services and the freedom of
establishment was found to have horizontal direct effects (see case Angonese,
C-281/98), provisions on the free movement of goods and capital was not
(see case Siillhofer, C-65/86).

The principle of direct effect has a different magnitude in consideration
of the type of the European provision with respect to which the principle
is invoked:

a) as far as primary legislation is concerned (i.e. the Treaties), the
principle of direct effect reaches its maximum extent; however, the
EC] laid down the condition that the obligations set by European
law must be precise, clear and unconditional and that they do not
call for additional measures, either national or European;

b) as far as the principle of direct effect relates to secondary legislation
(regulations, directives, decisions), its application depends on the

type of act:

a. regulations always have direct effect: Art. 288 TFEU
specifies that regulations are directly applicable in Member
States. The ECJ clarified in the Politi case (C-43/71) that

this is a complete direct effect;

b. in certain cases the ECJ recognised the direct effect of
directives in order to protect the rights of individuals.
The EC] laid down in its case-law that a directive has
direct effect when its provisions are unconditional and
sufficiently clear and precise and when the Member State

20
THE INTERNAL MARKET

has not transposed the directive by the deadline (see Van
Duyn case, 41/74);

C. decisions may have direct effect when they refer to a
Member State as the addressee, but in such case the EC]
therefore recognised only a direct vertical effect (see case

Hansa Fleisch, C-156/91).

5. No purely internal situations

The provisions of TFEU on the four economic freedoms do not apply
to a situation which is confined in all respects within a single Member
State (see Caixa d’Estalvis i Pensions de Barcelona, case C-139/12, Admiral
Casinos & Entertainment, C-464/15) and it is therefore a purely internal
situation, without a cross-border feature and an Internal Market relevance.

But ECJ has regarded as admissible requests for preliminary rulings
concerning the interpretation of provisions of the Treaties relating to the
fundamental economic freedoms, even though the disputes in the main
proceedings were confined in all respect within a single Member State.
The ECJ took this position on the ground that it was not inconceivable that
nationals established in other Member States had been, or were interested
in, making use of those freedoms for carrying on activities in the territory
of the Member State that had enacted the national legislation in question;
consequently, such legislation, applicable without distinction to nationals
of that State and those of other Member States, was deemed capable of
producing effects which were not confined to that Member State (see Blanco
Pérez and Chao Gémez, cases C-570/07 and C-571/07, Citroén Belux, case
C-265/12, Venturini and Others, cases C-159/12 to C-161/12).

Similarly, the ECJ found that, when the referring court makes a request
for a preliminary ruling in proceedings for the annulment of provisions
which apply not only to its own nationals but also to those of other Member
States, the decision of the referring court, that will be adopted following
the Court’s preliminary ruling, will also have effects on the nationals of
other Member States. Such opinion has justified the Court in considering
the referred question even though the dispute in the main proceedings was
confined in all respects within a single Member State (see Libert and Others,
cases C-197/11 and C-203/11).

It should, moreover, be recalled that the interpretation of the fundamental

21
R. Torino

economic freedoms provided for in Articles 49, 56 or 63 TFEU may prove
to be relevant in a case confined in all respects within a single Member
State, where national law requires the referring court to grant the same
rights to a national of its own Member State as those which a national of
another Member State in the same situation would derive from EU law (see
Guimont, case C-448/98, Susisalo and Others, case C-84/11, Ordine degli
Ingegneri di Verona e Provincia and Others, case C-111/12).

The same applies in cases in which, although the facts of the main
proceedings are outside the direct scope of EU law, the provisions of EU law
have been made applicable by national legislation, which, in dealing with
situations confined in all respects within a single Member State, follows the
same approach as that provided for by EU law (see Dzodzi, cases C-297/88
and C-197/89, Leur-Bloem, case C-28/95, Allianz Hungédria Biztosité and
Others, case C-32/11).

The ECJ puts the burden of proving the existence of any of the above considered situations on the referring judge (Ullens de Schooten, case C-268-15).
This means that national courts shall make an effort to explain why the referred
case falls under any of the situations in which prima facie the disputes in the
main proceedings were confined in all respect within a single Member State.
If the national court simply makes no effort whatsoever, then the Court will
declare the absence of a transfrontier link and the lack of arguments justifying
the application of any of the situations that can trigger its competence.

6. Policies completing the establishment of the Internal Market

Since the beginning, the European policy aimed at establishing the
Internal Market was accompanied by other specific policies devoted to
enhance the creation of a genuine domestic market with respect to some
specific product or with respect to some specific features of the market.

The common agriculture and fisheries policy is a clear example of the
specific consideration that the Internal Market policy devoted to a certain
kind of products which are considered with particular attention.

Article 38

1. The Union shall define and implement a common
agriculture and fisheries policy.

The internal market shall extend to agriculture, fisheries and

Debs
THE INTERNAL MARKET

trade in agricultural products. “Agricultural products” means
the products of the soil, of stockfarming and of fisheries and
products of first-stage processing directly related to these
products. References to the common agricultural policy or
to agriculture, and the use of the term “agricultural”, shall be
understood as also referring to fisheries, having regard to the
specific characteristics of this sector.

2. Save as otherwise provided in Articles 39 to 44, the rules
laid down for the establishment and functioning of the
internal market shall apply to agricultural products.

3. The products subject to the provisions of Articles 39 to 44
are listed in Annex I.

4. The operation and development of the internal market
for agricultural products must be accompanied by the
establishment of a common agricultural policy.

The rules on competition set by Title VII TFEU (Article 101 and
following) - which are addressed to undertakings operating within the
Internal market and to the Member States for achieving an (Internal) market structure based upon an ‘effective competition’ among all economic
operators - are an essential element of the Internal Market.

Other European policies can influence the establishment or the better
functioning of the Internal Market or are involved in its realization, ze. the
monetary policy, the common transport policy and other policies.

The connection — in some cases very deep - of these policies with the
establishment and the better functioning of the Internal Market results in
the high complexity of the European and national processes and relationships in order to achieve such goals.

Anyway, all these policies will not be addressed in this introduction to
the European Union Internal Market law. The limited scope of this introduction requires that it is focused only on the four economic freedoms.

In particular:

a) Chapter 2 will be focused on the free movement of goods;
b) Chapter 3 will be focused on the free movement of workers;
c) Chapter 4 will be focused on the free movement of services;

d) Chapter 5 will be focused on the free movement of capitals.

1. Introduction

The free movement of goods has traditionally been the most important
fundamental freedom within the internal market. Yet, in many respects,
the free movement of goods has for a long time provided a sort of model
to be followed by the other three fundamental freedoms.

Looking at this freedom diachronically, it is worth noting that, at the
outset, the EEC was created in a climate of trade liberalization, as a reaction
to the Second World War and the 1930s massive protectionism in response
to the Great Depression. As such, in the 1950s trade in goods was at the core
of all trade liberalization efforts, which was reflected in the legal structure of
EEC: its core was indeed constituted by a customs union, which provided
for free movement of goods among Member States unrestrained by tariffs,
quantitative restrictions or measures having equivalent effects.

However, the EEC was more than just a customs union as it aimed at
reaching a progressive integration of the economies of the Member States
and, ultimately, a common or single market. As such, the prohibition of
taxes that discriminate against imports was equally central to the single
market ideal. In fact, customs duties apply when goods cross the border; a
State may however discriminate against imports through differential taxes
when goods are in its country.

Along the same path, the intention to reach an effective model of free

33
F. RAFFAELE

movement of goods prescribed the introduction of certain provisions which
were able to prevent Member States from placing quotas on the amount of
goods that could be imported, or restricting their flow by measures that have
an equivalent effect to such quotas.

As a result of the foregoing, the Treaty regime for goods was split over
two sites within Part HI of the TFEU. Specifically, it finds its principal place
in Title I, governing the free movement of goods, and is complemented by
a chapter on tax provisions within Title VII. Indeed, the Treaty distinguishes
between fiscal and regulatory restrictions: the former are essentially
pecuniary duties specifically imposed on imports; the latter are basically
measures that limit market access by regulatory means.

More particularly, the Treaty aims at eliminating all restrictions on the
cross-border trade of goods with three main instruments: (2) a customs
union, in which customs duties between Member States are prohibited and
a common customs tariff in relation to third countries is established (Articles
28 - 32 TFEU); (2) the prohibition of discriminatory taxation on goods
from other Member States (Article 110 TFEU); and (zzz) the abolition of all
quantitative restrictions, and measures having equivalent effects, on imports
and exports between Member States (Articles 34 - 36 TFEU).

Beginning from the last group of provisions, it may be worth recalling
that goods originating in one Member State have the right to be exported
from that State under Article 35 TFEU and the right to be imported
into another Member State under Article 34 TFEU: in this respect, such
rights are protected through the bans contemplated thereunder to both
quantitative restrictions and measures having equivalent effects. However,
both Articles 34 and 35 are subject to the exhaustive list of derogations
found in Article 36 TFEU, which can be invoked by the home or host State
to justify a refusal to allow the import or export of particular goods.

While Articles 34 - 36 TFEU address non-fiscal barriers to trade,
Articles 28 - 30 and 110 TFEU concern fiscal barriers to trade. Specifically,
Article 30 prohibits customs duties and charges having equivalent effects
and concerns charges levied at the frontier of a State. By contrast, Article
110 TFEU regards charges that are levied internally within the State on
imported, exported and domestic products. While Article 30 contains an
absolute prohibition on duties, Article 110 bans only discriminatory taxation.
In any case, there is no equivalent to the express derogations found in
Article 36, in respect of Articles 30 and 110.

THE FREE MOVEMENT OF Goops

2. Basic Concepts

Prior to getting to the merits of the aforesaid three main groups of
provisions and related jurisprudence of the Court of Justice (hereinafter, the
Court) which has greatly contributed to shaping such articles of the Treaty,
it is worth briefly analyzing certain features that appear to be equally valid
in respect of all the provisions mentioned above.

For the Treaty provisions on goods to be engaged, three conditions need
being satisfied: (z) the product must be deemed as a «good»; (ii) the good
must be used in cross-border trade between Member States; (277) the person
to whom the provision is being applied must be an addressee of the Treaty.

The Court has defined «goods as products that can be valued in money
and which are capable, as such, of forming the subject of commercial
transactions (see Commission v. Italy (Art Treasures), Case 7/68) and possess
tangible physical characteristics (see Jagerskiéld v. Gustaffson, Case C-97/98).
Generally, the definition of goods poses few issues. Some products, however,
are difficult to classify: for example, the Court has found that electricity
does fall within the concept of goods (see Almelo v. Energi bedriff Ijsselmij,
Case C-393/92), but most other intangible products do not (see Criminal
Proceeding Against Giuseppe Sacchi, Case 155/73)

As to the material scope of the relevant Treaty provisions, Articles 30,
34, 35, 36 and 110 TFEU apply to the movement of goods across national
borders. In other words, there must be a cross-border element, meaning that
goods must either originate in the Member States and be traded between
them, or come from third countries and be in free circulation in the Union
(Article 28(2) TFEU). Generally, where there is no cross-border movement
of goods, EU law does not apply: as a result, Member States are free to apply
reverse discrimination, that is, treating domestically produced goods less
favorably than imports (see Commission v. Austria, Case C-320/03).

As to the personal scope, Articles 30, 34, 35, 36 and 110 TFEU apply
irrespective of the nationality of the traders involved (see Social Fonds voor
de Diamantarbeiders v. Choral Diamond Co, Cases 2-3/69). On the other
hand, such provisions apply to Member States: however, the word «State»
has been broadly construed so as to cover also central and local governments
(see Aragonesa de Publicidad Exterior SA v. Departmento de Sanidad y
Seguridad Social de la Generalitat de Catalunya, Joined Cases C-1 & 176/90)
as well as other arms of government in whatever capacity they are acting
(see Commission v. Belgium (Public Warehouses), Case 132/82) and even
professional regulatory bodies and private bodies supported by the State,

35
either financially or sub specie supervision (see R. v. Royal Pharmaceutical
Society ex p. API, Joined Cases 266 & 267/87, or Essent Netwerk Noord v.
Aluminium Delfzijl, Case C-206/06).

The corollary of the foregoing is that the Treaty provisions on goods do
not apply to private parties acting in a purely private capacity. Conversely,
they apply to non-State actors only if their activities can be attributed to the
State (see Commission v. Ireland (Buy Irish Campaign), Case 249/81). In other
words, given that these provisions have direct effect (see Carmine Capolongo
v. Azienda Agricola Maya, Case 77/72, Procurer du Roi v. Dassonville, Case
8/74, Pig Marketing Board v. Redmond, Case 83/78, Fink-Frucht GmbH v.
Hauptzollamt Miinchen-Landsbergerstrasse, Case 27/67), they however have
vertical, but not horizontal, direct effect. Nevertheless, Member States may be
held responsible for the actions of private actors under certain circumstances
(sometimes referred to “indirect” horizontal effect, see Commission v. France
(Spanish Strawberries), Case C-265/95).

Finally, the Treaty provisions on goods also apply to the institutions
of the EU: secondary EU law (z.e., law enacted by the Union institutions)
must comply with primary law, including the Treaty freedoms. In such
cases, the Court has routinely acknowledged the broad discretion of the
Union legislature, therefore ruling only against measures that are manifestly
inappropriate having regard to the objective which the competent institution
is seeking to pursue (see Alliance for Natural Health and Others, Joined Cases
C-154 8155/04).

3. Customs Union

As anticipated, the free movement of goods may be impeded by customs
duties (or charges having equivalent effects) which make foreign products
more expensive than domestic ones. Therefore, their abolition is a key issue
in building a customs union and a single market.

Article 28(1) TFEU is the foundational provision of this part of the Treaty:

Article 28 TFEU
1. The Union shall comprise a customs union which shall
cover all trade in goods and which shall involve the prohibition
between Member States of custom duties on imports and exports
and of all charges having equivalent effect, and the adoption of

a common customs tariff in their relation with third countries.
Article 28 makes clear that the free movement of goods has both an
internal and an external dimension. From the former point of view, goods
that have their origin within the EU benefit from the right of free movement
among Member States. From the latter perspective, products originating
outside the EU may be entitled to free movement so long as they have paid
the common customs tariff, if due. In other words, whereas EU law prohibits
tariffs (z.e., custom duties) on goods that cross EU internal frontiers (ze.,
among Member States), tariffs are allowed on goods crossing the EU external
frontiers (z.e., coming from non-member countries). Only after paying the
common customs tariff, if any, the third-country goods may legally enter the
EU, being therefore in “free circulation” and enjoying the same right of free
movement as the goods originating in the EU.

As we will focus only on the internal dimension of the free movement of
goods, it is worth noting that Article 28 must be analyzed in conjunction with
Article 30 TFEU, which reads as follows:

Article 30 TFEU
1. Custom duties on imports and exports and charges having
equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States.
This prohibition shall also apply to customs duties of a fiscal

nature.

The absolute prohibition contained in Article 30 was shaped in the current
way by the Amsterdam Treaty, which replaced the former standstill clause that
could be found in Article 12 EEC, pursuant to which: «Member States shall
refrain from introducing between themselves any new customs duties on imports or
exports or any charges having equivalent effect, and from increasing those which they
already apply in their trade with each other».

As opposed to the approach under Article 12 EEC, which only prevented
Member States from introducing new duties and increasing existing ones, Article 30

TFEU prohibits altogether both customs duties and charges having equivalent effects.
3.1. Customs Duties

In Social Fonds voor de Diamantarbeiders v. Choral Diamond Co, Cases
2-3/69, the Court clarified that a custom duty is a pecuniary charge imposed
on goods by reason of the fact that they have crossed a frontier and paid by the
importer to the host State.
F. RAFFAELE

In a prior case (Van Gend en Loos v. Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen,
Case 26/62) — where customs duties on a product named ureaformaldehyde were
increased from 5% to 8% by the Dutch government — the Court made also
clear that customs duties are per se unlawful under Article 30, however small
they are.

Finally, according to the Court, the application of Article 30 TFEU depends
upon the effect of the duty, not on its purpose (and the same conclusions apply
to charges having equivalent effects), and even if the concerned measure was not
designed with protectionism in mind. In fact, in Commission v. Italy, Case 7/68,
when deciding upon a tax Italy had imposed on the export of artistic, historical,
and archaeological items, the Court rejected the arguments put forward by Italy,
according to which the items should not be regarded as goods for the purpose
of customs union and the purpose of the tax was not to raise revenues but to
protect the artistic heritage of the country.

3.2. Charges Having an Equivalent Effect

Article 30 TFEU prohibits not only custom duties, but also charges having
an equivalent effect (hereinafter, “CHEEs”), in order to ban protectionist
measures that have the same effect as a customs duty.

As such, the notion of CHEE is necessarily broader than that of
customs duty. The Court provided a definition of a CHEE in Commission
v. Luxembourg (Gingerbread), Cases 2-3/62: specifically, a duty, whatever is
called, and whatever its mode of application, may be considered a charge
having equivalent effect to a customs duty, provided that it meets the following
three criteria: (a) it must be imposed unilaterally at the time of importation
or subsequently; (4) it must be imposed specifically upon a product imported
from a Member State to the exclusion of a similar national product; and (c) it
must result in an alteration of price and thus have the same effect as a customs
duty on the free movement of goods.

This was developed further in Commission v. Italy (Statistical Levy), Case
24/68, where the Court gave a fuller definition of CHEEs whereby any
pecuniary charge, however small and whatever its designation and mode
of application, which is imposed unilaterally on domestic or foreign goods
by reason of the fact that they cross a frontier, and which is not a customs
duty in the strict sense, constitutes a charge having equivalent effect, even
if it is not imposed for the benefit of the State, is not discriminatory or
protective in effect and if the product on which the charge is imposed is not
in competition with the domestic product.

38
THE FREE MOVEMENT OF Goops

The foregoing definition emphasizes the following aspects: (z) reference
to «pecuniary charges» makes clear that Article 30 applies only to fiscal
measures; (zz) reference to «However small» reminds us that no de minimis
rule plays a role in applying Article 30; (az) reference to «whatever its
designation and mode of application» indicates that it is irrelevant how the
Member State describes or qualifies the charge; (iv) reference to «cross a
frontiem reinforces the point that Article 30 is different from Article 110
TFEU because the former provision applies to charges levied at the frontier
(either national or regional, z.¢., internal to a particular State), whereas the
latter provision applies to charges levied internally within the Member
State; (v) reference to the «effect» as well as to the irrelevance of the purpose
of the CHEEs clarifies that CHEEs themselves are prohibited regardless of
(a) any consideration on the reason why they were introduced, and (4) the
destination of the revenue obtained, as well as (c) the potentially beneficial
purpose of the CHEEs or the fact that the money obtained is not used to
the benefit of the national treasury.

3.3. “Exceptions” to the Ban

As made clear in the preceding paragraphs, Article 30 TFEU may
not be derogated. However, the Court, in Commission v. Germany, Case
18/87, recognized that a charge is lawful if it relates to a general system
of internal dues applied systematically and in accordance with the same
criteria to domestic products and imported products alike, if it constitutes
payment for a service in fact rendered to the economic operator of a sum
in proportion to the service, or again, subject to certain conditions, if it
attaches to inspections carried out to fulfil obligation imposed by EU law.

With regard to the defense «charges for services rendered», it was originally
an argument advanced by the Italian government in the aforementioned
case Commission v. Italy (Statistical Levy). Although rejected at that time on
the basis of the facts of the case before it, the Court appeared to allow some
room for the potential of such justification. In fact, in the aforesaid case
Diamantarbeiders, the Court acknowledged that although it is not impossible
that in certain circumstances a specific service actually rendered may form the
consideration for a possible proportional payment for the service in question,
this may only apply in specific cases which cannot lead to the circumvention
of the provisions of the relevant articles of the Treaty.

From that time on, this argument has been raised in many cases and
the Court has repeatedly clarified that the following requirements must

39
F. RAFFAELE

apply: (z) the charge must be the consideration for a service that must
confer a specific benefit on the individual importer/exporter; and (zz) the
charge must be of an amount commensurate with the service provided.

In particular, in Bresciani v. Amministrazione Italiana delle Finanze,
Case 87/75, the Court — focusing on whom benefited from the service
provided in relation to a charge imposed on imported raw cowhides for
veterinary and public health inspections — held that such system of public
health inspections was designed for the general interest and, therefore,
could not be regarded as a service rendered to the importer, so as to justify
the imposition of a pecuniary charge. As such, the monetary charge was
thus deemed to be a CHEE.

On the other hand, in Ford Espana SA v. Estado Espanol, Case 170/88, the
Court stroke down a charge imposed in relation with operations incidental
to customs clearance when performed in places not open to public and
calculated in proportion of the declared value of the imported goods. Indeed,
even if levied for a service actually rendered, the charge was to be considered
as a CHEE because its amount could not be proportionate to the service
provided, as it was based on the value of the goods concerned rather than the
costs borne in relation to the service.

With regard to the defense relating to the inspections to be undertaken
by a Member State, it is worth noting that where EU law permits an
inspection, the national authorities cannot recover any fees charged from
the traders (see Commission v. Belgium, Case 314/82). Conversely, where
EU law requires a mandatory inspection to be undertaken (for example in
case of veterinary inspections on the transit and importation of live animals
from Member States, as in Bauhuis v. Netherlands State, Case 46/76, and
Commission v. Germany, Case 18/87), a charge levied by a State to cover the
cost of such inspection may escape the ban provided for by Article 30 TFEU
so long as four conditions are satisfied: (a) the fees do not exceed the actual
costs of the inspections in connection with which they are charged; (0) the
inspections are obligatory and uniform for all the products concerned in
the Union; (c) such inspections are prescribed by EU law in the general
interest of the Union; and (d) they promote the free movement of goods,
in particular by neutralizing obstacles which could arise from unilateral
measures of inspection adopted in accordance with Article 36 TFEU (see
the aforesaid cases Bauhuis and Commission v. Germany).

Other than those listed above, there are no other grounds upon which a

Member State can seek to derogate from Article 30 TFEU.

40
THE FREE MOVEMENT OF Goops

3.4. Remedies

As recognized by the Court in Amministrazione delle Finanze dello
Stato v. San Giorgio, Case 199/82, the general principle in the context of
remedies available to the trader is that the latter may bring a restitutionary
claim against the Member State to obtain the repayment of the customs
duties or CHEEs that have been unlawfully levied.

However, there is an exception to the foregoing general rule. Indeed,
the Court clarified that no such restitutionary claim would be available
should the trader have passed the loss onto customers, since, in such
a case, reimbursement may lead to the trader being unjustly enriched.
Nevertheless, as the Court ruled in Soczeté Comatech v. Directeur Général des
Douanes et Droits Indirect, Case C-192/95, should the burden of the charge
have been passed only in part onto third parties (e.g., the final consumer),
on the one hand, the trader would still be entitled to recovery for the
remaining part, and on the other hand, said third parties would have the
right to obtain reimbursement from either the trader or the Member State.
In case the trader had actually paid such third parties, it should in turn be
able to be repaid by the national authorities (see also Lady & Kid A/S v.
Skatteministeriet, Case C-398/09).

Finally, the Court recognized that, should the trader be able to show
that it has suffered loss of sales caused by the circumstance that it passed
onto third parties — who would likely not buy the trader’s products — the
charge unlawfully levied, it may then claim damages (see again Societé
Comatech).

As decided by the Court in Dilexport Srl v. Amministrazione delle Finanze
dello Stato (Case C-343/96), national procedural rules govern the actions
for restitution and damages (in accordance with the principle of national
procedural autonomy). However, they (z) must not be less favorable than
those relating to similar charges imposed by domestic law (principle of nondiscrimination), and (22) must not make recovery impossible or excessively
difficult (principle of effectiveness). On the other hand, national time limits
also apply to the foregoing suits to the extent they are reasonable and do
not infringe the two principles mentioned above (see Edis v. Ministero delle

Finanze, Case C-231/96).

41
F. RAFFAELE

4. Internal Taxation

The preceding paragraph focused on Articles 28 - 30 TFEU, which
address fiscal barriers to trade levied at the frontier. The focus now shifts
to fiscal rules which apply internally within a Member State. Article 110
TFEU, which is the central provision, prohibits discriminatory taxes and
reads as follows:

Article 110 TFEU
1. No Member State shall impose, directly or indirectly, on
the products of other Member States any internal taxation
of any kind in excess of that imposed directly or indirectly
on similar domestic products.

2. Furthermore, no Member State shall impose on the products

of other Member States any internal taxation of such nature as
to afford indirect protection to other products.

The goal of Article 110 TFEU is to prevent the objectives of Articles 28
- 30 from being undermined by discriminatory internal taxation. As such,
Article 110 is designed to prevent a Member State from disadvantaging
imported products (in competition with domestic goods) by levying discriminatory taxes on such foreign products when they are inside its territory.

Specifically, Article 110 refers to national taxation systems. According to
Denkavit v. France, Case 132/78, internal taxation can be defined as a general system of internal dues applied systematically and in accordance with
the same criteria to domestic products and imported products alike. Internal
taxation can be therefore distinguished from customs duties and charges
having equivalent effects: whereas a charge is a tax if it is part of an internal
taxation system, as defined in Denkavit, customs duties and charges having
equivalent effects are charges levied on goods by virtue of importation.

In this respect, Articles 110 and 30 TFEU are mutually exclusive
because a charge cannot be at the same time a tax and a duty (or a CHEE).
As a result, should the charge be considered as a duty (or a CHEB), it is
altogether unlawful pursuant to Article 30; should it be considered as a
tax, it may be permissible so long as it complies with Article 110.

Finally, it is worth noting that national taxation per se is not prohibited
under EU law; rather, it is prohibited to the extent it discriminates between
imported and domestically produced goods.

42
THE FREE MOVEMENT OF Goops

4.1. Similar goods

As seen, Article 110 TFEU draws a distinction between «szmilam products
and products in competition. The first step, therefore, to apply Article 110(1)
or (2) is to determine whether the goods are «similam.

In a number of cases, the Court has construed «similam very broadly,
meaning with similar characteristics and comparable use (see Commission
v. France, Case 168/78). At an earlier stage, this led to the adoption of the
so-called globalized approach, that is, that Article 110 was taken as a whole
and applied without distinction to all the products concerned.

Such approach, however, appeared to be problematic, especially because
it did not clearly distinguish between «similam and “competing” products.
As a result, by generalizing the application of Article 110(1), due to the
aforementioned broad interpretation of “similarity”, the differences between
the appropriate responses against the infringing State — z.e., imposing the
equalization of the tax burdens on the domestic and the imported goods
under Article 110(1), or the removal of the protective effect pursuant to
Article 110(2) — could have been de facto obscured.

Later cases were thus more rigorous in analyzing the «similam requirement
and therefore distinguishing between Article 110(1) and (2) TFEU. In this
respect, the Court said that, even though similarity is wider than identity, and
relates somehow with comparability, such concept must rest upon objective
criteria. For instance, in John Walker v. Ministeriet for Skatter og Afgifter,
Case 243/84, when considering the similarity of Scotch whisky and liquor
fruit wine, the Court took into account the characteristics of the products,
their alcohol content, their methods of manufacture and the consumer
perceptions. Or in Commission v. Italy, Case 184/85, when deciding upon
a consumption tax imposed by Italy on bananas imported from France,
the Court analyzed the objective characteristics of bananas and other fruits
produced in Italy (such as oranges, peaches, pears and apples), including their
organoleptic properties, and their ability to satisfy the same consumer needs.

4.2. Direct vs. Indirect Discrimination

If the products are similar, the taxation must then be the same and the
goods must not be discriminated either directly or indirectly.

Measures that tax domestic and imported goods at different rates or
that tax only imported products are directly discriminatory. For example, in

43
F. RAFFAELE

Liitticke (Alfons) GmbH v. Hauptzollamt Sarrelouis, Case 57/65, the Court
found that Germany directly discriminated powdered milk imported from
Luxembourg because it was subject to a tax not payable by the German
product. Conversely, in Haahr Petroleum v. Abenra. Haun, Case C-90/94,
the fact that imported goods unloaded at certain Danish ports where subject
to an additional 40% surcharge on the shipping tax imposed by Denmark
on domestic goods was considered by the Court as another example of
direct discrimination.

In the absence of any express defense to Article 110(1), all directly
discriminatory measures adopted in violation of such provision must be
removed and the tax must be equalized.

On the other hand, indirect discriminatory taxation appears on its
face (in law) not to discriminate products on the basis of their origin, but
nevertheless has a discriminatory effect in reality (in fact) by imposing a
certain burden on the imported goods. Humblot v. Directeur des Services
Fiscaux, Case 112/84, provides a good illustration of such discrimination:
French tax on cars distinguished between cars below and above 16 hp and
taxed the latter much more than the former. Although “in law” the measure
was not discriminatory, the Court found this system to indirectly discriminate
cars manufactured in other Member States as no cars with engine capacity of
over 16 hp were produced in France at that time.

Unlike directly discriminatory measures, taxes that indirectly discriminate
goods on the basis of their origin may not amount to a breach of Article
110(1) to the extent they can be objectively justified on the basis of a national
interest that can be invoked by the defendant Member State. However,
no violation of the aforementioned provision may be detected only if: (a)
such interest (z) is unrelated to the origin of the goods; and (#) pursues an
objective recognized by EU law as legitimate; and (4) the steps taken to
protect said interest are proportionate. For instance, the Court considered
as a valid justification for the purposes of Article 110(1) the environmental
argument adopted by Greece when defending its car tax system providing
for differential rates depending on diverse power rating (see Commission v.

Greece, Case C-132/88).
4.3. Competing Goods
Where imported and domestic goods are not «similam pursuant to and

for the purposes of Article 110(1), but in competition (even if only partially,
indirectly, or potentially) with each other, then Article 110(2) kicks in. The

44
THE FREE MOVEMENT OF Goops

object is to prevent differential tax ratings from affording indirect protection
to the domestic products to the detriment of the imported ones.

The tests adopted to determine whether or not two products are in
competition with each other include the analyses on (2) manufacturing
processes; (27) product composition; (zz) consumer preferences; and, more
often, (iv) cross-elasticity of demand (that is, the positive effect on the
demand of a product, which increases, due to a reduction in the availability,
or an increase in price, of the other product).

For example, in Commission v. U.K., Case 170/78, the Court Stated
that the higher excise duties imposed by U.K. on wine, as opposed to beer,
amounted to a violation of Article 110(2) because wine and beer could be
substituted for by each other and both belonged to the same category of
alcoholic beverages as they both were product of natural fermentation and met
the same purposes as thirst-quenching and meal-accompanying beverages.

4.4. Remedies

As anticipated, the kind of remedy applicable in the cases at stake
depends on whether a breach of Article 110(1) or (2) is actually detected.

Should Article 110(1) be applicable, the infringing Member State
must — depending on the circumstances — either equalize the tax burden
imposed on domestic and imported products or extend to the imported
goods a tax benefit previously granted to the domestic goods alone (or,
conversely, deprive the domestic goods of a benefit accorded to them).

On the other hand, should Article 110(2) be applicable, the infringing
Member State must remove altogether the protective element. No equalization
of the tax burden is then required.

The foregoing scenarios are relevant in case the Commission brings an
action in court against the infringing Member State. However, should an
individual sue the Member State on the basis of a violation of Article 110
TFEU — which can be done given that said provision is directly effective
(see, amongst others, Fink-Frucht GmbH v. Hauptzollamt MiinchenLandsbergerstrasse, Case 27/67, and Mélkerei-Zentrale Westfalen/Lippe GmbH
v. Hauptzollamt Paderborn, Case 28/67) — both a restitutionary action (for
the repayment of the unlawful charges levied in breach of Article 110) and
damages may be claimed (see Hans Just I/S v. Danish Ministry for Fiscal
Affairs, Case 68/79).

F. RAFFAELE

5. Restrictions on Imports and Exports and their Justifications under EU Law

The preceding paragraphs focused on customs duties and taxes. However,
the strategy for achieving a single market integration comprises also provisions
on non-fiscal regulatory national barriers to trade, z.¢. essentially quotas on
the amount of goods that can be imported (or exported) and measures having
an equivalent effect (hereinafter, “MHEEs”) to quotas.

The Treaty regime for regulatory barriers is set out in Chapter 3 of
Title II. The chapter outlaws quantitative restrictions on imports (Article
34) and exports (Article 35). Yet it also contains a provision according to
which restrictions on imports or exports can be justified (Article 36).

It is worth noting that, contrary to the legal regime governing customs
duties, that concerning regulatory barriers (2) separately contemplates a
prohibition for imports and another for exports; and (2) expressly allows
for exceptions.

Article 34 TFEU provides:

Article 34 TFEU

Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having
equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States.

Article 35 TFEU is drafted in the same terms, but regards exports.

As anticipated, the Treaty allows national measures to prevail over
the free movement of goods, subject to certain conditions. In particular,
pursuant to Article 36 TFEU, such measures must be aimed at protecting
substantial interests recognized as to be valuable by the Union such as:

Article 36 TFEU
[...] public morality, public policy or public security; the
protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants;
the protection of national treasures possessing artistic, historic
and archaeological value; or the protection of industrial and
commercial property.

In addition, the foregoing exhaustive list of derogations must be read
in conjunction with the following sentence of Article 36 TFEU pursuant
to which:

46
THE FREE MOVEMENT OF Goops

Article 36 TFEU
[...] Such prohibitions or restrictions shall not, however,
constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised
restriction on trade between Member States.

Finally, the national measures must go no further than what is necessary
to achieve the concerned goal. In other words, they must comply with the
principle of proportionality. In Commission v. UK (mports of Poultry Meat),
Case 40/82, the Court rejected the UK government’s argument for the
restrictive measures due to their lack of proportionality to the risk identified.

It is also worth noting that Article 36 TFEU applies only in the
absence of EU legislation governing the interest at stake. Should this be
the case, Member States may not impose additional requirements, unless
the said European rules expressly so permit.

5.1 Quantitative Restrictions

The notion of quantitative restrictions was broadly defined by the
Court in Geddo v. Ente Nazionale Risi, Case 2/73, as measures which
amount to a total or partial restraint of, according to the circumstances,
imports, exports or goods in transit.

As such, quantitative restrictions may include (z) bans on imports or
exports; (zz) quotas limiting the quantity of goods entering or leaving a
State; or (ziz) specific limitations by a State to the import/export of a certain
good whereas it is generally allowed by the same State.

In Regina v. Hann and Darby, Case 34/79, the Court recognized that
the UK ban (the most extreme form of prohibition) on the import of
pornographic materials was in breach of Article 34 TFEU. Additionally,
in Etablissements Delhaize Freres et Compagnie Le Lion SA v. Promalvin
SA and AGE Bodegas Unidas SA, Case C-47/90, the Court ruled that
the Spanish law provision which limited the quantity of wine that could
be exported to other Member States (and which, in the instant case,
prevented a Belgian company from importing 3,000 hectoliters of the
Spanish wine “Rioja’) resulted in a violation of Article 35 TFEU. Finally,
in Rosengren v. Riksaklagaren, Case C-170/04, the Court considered as a
quantitative restriction (prohibited as such pursuant to Article 34 TFEU)
the Swedish law that prevented consumers from buying alcoholic drinks
on the internet or by mail, but allowed them to buy such drinks through

47
F. RAFFAELE

the State-owned company (Systembolaget) which had a monopoly in retail
sales of wine, beer and spirits in Sweden.

5.2. Measures Having an Equivalent Effect

MHEEs are more difficult to define. The Commission, at first, and
the Court, then, took a broad interpretation on these measures.

In particular, all the items listed under Directive 70/50/EEC represent
ways in which a State can discriminate against imported goods. Specifically,
Directive 70/50 was originally a transitional measure which, although
no longer formally applicable, continues to furnish guidance on the
Commission’s view of MHEEs. The list of measures that can constitute
a MHEE is contemplated under Article 2 and comprises, inter alia: (i)
imposing minimum or maximum prices for imported goods; (22) fixing less
favorable prices for imported products; (zz) lowering the value of imported
goods by causing a reduction in their intrinsic value or increasing their costs;
(tv) establishing payment conditions for imported products different from
those of domestic ones; (v) imposing harder conditions of packaging, shape,
size, weight, composition, presentation and identification for imported
goods than domestic ones; (vz) prohibiting or limiting the publicity of
imported products; (viz) prohibiting, limiting or requiring stocking in
respect of imported goods only.

MHEEs were later defined in the seminal early judicial decision on
the interpretation of MHEEs, that is Procurer du Roi v. Dassonville, Case
8/74. The Court, in what has become known as the “Dassonville formula’,
construed MHEEs as all trading rules enacted by Member States which
are capable of hindering, directly or indirectly, actually or potentially,
intra-community trade.

Pursuant to the Dassonville formula, Article 34 TFEU applies to
«trading rules», meaning that they concern the marketing stage, and not
the production stage, of the economic process (see Officier Van Justitie v.
Cornelis Kramer and Others, Case 3/76).

The Court has however subsequently clarified that the «ru/e» need not
being legally binding, given that the Treaty refers to «measures» as opposed
to specific language with technical legal meaning. As such, in Commission v.
Ireland (Buy Irish Campaign, Case 249/81), the Court defined as a national
practice introduced by the Irish government and prosecuted with its assistance
the campaign sponsored by said Irish government, recommending the citizens
to buy Irish goods, and recognized that such a practice may have a potential

48
THE FREE MOVEMENT OF Goops

effect on imports, by influencing the behavior of traders and consumers in
Ireland, comparable to that resulting from binding governmental measures.
Subsequently, the Court ruled that not only the term «rules encompasses
practices and policies, but also administrative regulations and actions that
show a certain degree of consistency and generality: in fact, in Commission
v. France (Postal Franking Machines), Case 21/84, the French administrative
practice requiring prior approval for postal franking machines — which in
the instant case was granted to French machines but not to UK ones — was
deemed to be in violation of Article 34 TFEU.

In light of the foregoing, also the element «enacted by Member States» of
the Dassonville formula later appeared to be misleading and, therefore, was
substituted for by a broader construction of the relevant terms. In particular,
a domestic measure needs not being formally enacted to fall within the
scope of Article 34 TFEU so long as it amounts to a consistent policy or
practice (see Buy Irish Campaign). In addition, the «rule» do not need to
be «enacted» by the central government of a Member State, as the Court
has applied Article 34 TFEU also to measures adopted by (z) territorial
authorities of a federal State (see Aragonesa de Publicidad Exterior SA v.
Departmento de Sanidad y Seguridad Social de la Generalitat de Catalunya,
Joined Cases C-1 & 176/90, or Commission v. Ireland (Dundalk Water),
Case 45/87); (iz) quasi-government bodies (see again Buy Irish Campaign,
where the campaign was administered by the Irish Goods Council, a
registered company whose management committee and financial resources
came from the Irish government); (72) bodies that regulate the conduct of
a particular profession (such as the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great
Britain — ze, the professional body for pharmacy — in Regina. v. Royal
Pharmaceutical Society ex p. API, Joined Cases 266 & 267/87); (iv) other
bodies — such as trade unions (see nternational Transport Workers Federation
v. Viking Line ABP, Case C-438/05) — that have enough power to interfere
with the free movement provisions.

Even though Article 34 TFEU has only “vertical” direct effects (and
not “horizontal” ones), as it is addressed to Member States and not to
private parties (see Sapod-Audic v. Eco-Emballages SA, Case C-159/00), a
State may have to take responsibility for the actions of individuals either,
directly or indirectly, because Article 34 prohibits not only State action,
but also inaction (see Commission v. France (Spanish Strawberries), Case
C-265/95). However, liability arises only where the State has manifestly and
persistently abstained from adopting appropriate and adequate measures
to put an end to individual actions that hinder free movement (see again

49
F. RAFFAELE

Spanish Strawberries), whereas less serious interference by individuals will
not bring about such liability (see Schmidberger, Internationale Transporte
und Planziige v. Republic of Austria, Case C-112/00).

The third element of the Dassonville formula («directly or indirectly,
actually or potentially) is by far the most important, especially in light of
the recent trend in the Court's decisions, which have largely dropped any
reference to the first two elements of the formula, given the troublesome
interpretive questions that said two prongs had raised in the past, in order
to adopt a more liberal approach which now focuses on any measure capable
of hindering the free movement of goods (see A.G.M.-COS.MET Srl v.
Suomen valtio and Tarmo Lehtinen, Case C-470/03). In this respect, the
jurisprudence of the Court has made clear that the focus of the analysis is
on the effect of the measure at stake, irrespective of the intention behind
such measure.

As to the first subpart of this element («actually or potentially), the
Court has recognized that it may be sufficient that the measure have only a
potential effect on the free movement of goods, as in Commission v. France
(foie gras), Case C-184/96: even though other Member States produced very
little foie gras, the French rules on the composition of said foie gras amounted
to a violation of Article 34 TFEU because they were capable of hindering, at
least potentially, inter-State trade. As a result, no de minimis rule applies in
relation to Article 34 TFEU (see Criminal Proceeding against Ditlev Bluhme,
Case C-67/97). However, especially in borderline cases, where a trading rule
in the narrow sense of the term is not concerned, the Court has adopted
a remoteness test whereby, should the risk for the concerned measure to
hinder trade between Member States be too uncertain and indirect, Article
34 TFEU would not apply (see H. Krantz GmbH & Co. v. Ontvanger der
Directe Belastingen and Staat der Nederlanden, Case 69/88).

As to the second subpart of the element («directly or indirectly»), an
important distinction must be drawn between distinctly and indistinctly
applicable measures. Such categories have originally been introduced by
the above-mentioned Directive 70/50/EEC. Indeed, as anticipated, Article
2 of the Directive referred to measures that are not «applicable equally to
domestic and imported products. By contrast, national measures that are
«applicable equally» were not generally seen as equivalent to those of quantitative restrictions. However, Article 3 exceptionally extended the concept
of MHEEs to a non-exhaustive list of measures equally applicable to domestic and imported goods (paying special attention on the importance of a test
of proportionality), as it provided as follows: « This Directive also covers mea
50
THE FREE MOVEMENT OF Goops

sures governing the marketing of products which deal, in particular, with shape,
size, weight, composition, presentation, identification, or putting up and which
are equally applicable to domestic and imported products, where the restrictive
effect of such measures on the free movement of goods exceeds the effects intrinsic
to trade rules. This is the case, in particular, where: - the restrictive effects on
the free movement of goods are out of proportion to their purpose; - the same
objective can be attained by other means which are less of hindrance to trade».

The Dassonville formula adopted a different approach. According to
said formula, it is irrelevant whether the measure is distinctly or indistinctly applicable. It covers both types of measures, 7.¢., those which explicitly
differentiate between domestic and imported goods (imposing heavier
burdens on the latter) and those which do not do this on the face of it,
but impose anyhow an indirect hurdle to trade.

Contrary to the Dassonville formula, the case law followed the aforesaid
distinction drawn in the Directive until the early 2000s. However, more
recent cases have paid less attention to whether the measure is discriminatory,
focusing instead on the obstacles to market access created by such measure,
thereby restoring the original market access approach found in Dassonville.
In any case, the distinction is still relevant with regard to justifications, as
we will see below.

5.2.1. Distinctly Applicable Measures

National distinctly applicable measures treat imported and domestic goods
differently. As such, this concept is mostly synonymous with “discriminatory”
measures. This is generally known as “formal discrimination’, it is typically
easy to be identified and examples of national distinctly applicable measures
include the following: (2) imposing additional requirements only on
imported goods (see Firma Denkavit Futtermittel GmbH v. Minister fiir
Ernihrung, Case 251/78); (22) limiting channels of trade or distribution (see
Officier Van Justitie v. Adriaan de Peijper, Case 104/75, or Syndicat national
des fabricants raffineurs d huile de graissage v. Groupement d intérét économique
Inter-Huiles, Case 172/82); (zi) giving preference to, or advantage for,
domestic goods (so-called “buy national” rules, see Commission v. Ireland
(Buy Irish), Case 249/81, or Apple and Pear Development Council v. Lewis
(Buy British Fruit), Case 222/82); (iv) requiring an indication of the country
of origin for foreign products (see Commission v. Ireland (Irish Souvenirs),
Case 113/80, or Commission v. UK (Origin Marking), Case 270/83), unless
such products have genuinely distinguishing qualities and characteristics due
to the fact that they originated in a specific geographic area (see Commission

51
F. RAFFAELE

v. Germany (Weinbrand), Case 12/74).

Article 34 TFEU captures also material discrimination, that is when
national and imported goods are treated in the same way if such equal
treatment is not objectively justified. A typical case is that of price-fixing
(see Criminal Proceeding against Riccardo Tasca, Case 65/75, or Openbaar
Ministerie v. van Tiggele, Case 82/77): in such circumstances, a Member
State sets either a minimum or a maximum price for a particular product
and, in so doing, it may discriminate the imported goods either because a
low maximum price may not financially take into account the costs borne
for their import, or because a high minimum price may eliminate any
competitive advantage they may have over domestic products.

Finally, the opposite case of “reverse discrimination”, meaning that
national rules discriminate against domestic goods (and not against
imported ones), is not within the scope of Article 34 TFEU because such
provision does not encompass wholly internal situations (see Criminal
Proceeding against Mathot, Case 98/86).

As anticipated, the qualification of a measure as distinctly applicable
(as opposed to indistinctly applicable) plays a role in determining the
possible justification for such a measure: in fact, a distinctly applicable
measure may only be justified by reference to one of the Article 36 TFEU
derogations, not by the broader list of judicially developed «mandatory
requirements», which apply only to indistinctly applicable measures (as we
will see below).

5.2.2. Indistinctly Applicable Measures

Indistinctly applicable measures apply a same burden in law, but a
different burden in fact (see ATRAL SA v. Etat belge, Case C-14/02): in
other words, they apply in law to both domestic and imported goods, but
impose in fact a particular burden on the imported ones. Since their “first”
appearance under the abovementioned Article 3 of Directive 70/50/EEC,
the Court has repeatedly declared unlawful such indistinctly applicable
measures, unless they can be somehow justified by the Member State.

Product requirements — ze., rules relating to designation, form, size,
weight, composition, presentation, labeling, and packaging — are the classic
example of indistinctly applicable measures. Specifically, case law has dealt
with measures regarding composition (see Cassis de Dijon, described in
detail below, or Drei Glocken GmbH v. USL Centro-Sud, Case 407/85),
packaging and presentation (see Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v. De Smedt
PVBA, Case 261/81, or Criminal Proceeding against Karl Prantl, Case 16/83,

52
THE FREE MOVEMENT OF Goops

or Vermin gegen Unwesen in Handel und Gewerbe Koln ev v. Mars GmbH,
Case C-470/93), designation (see Criminal Proceeding against Miro BV,
Case 182/84, or Commission v. Italy, Case C-14/00) as well as production
conditions (see Alfa Vita Vassilopoulos AE, Joined Cases C-158 & 159/04).
In the past, other measures have also been deemed as indistinctly applicable,
such as the so-called “market circumstances” rules, 7.e., measures concerning
time, place, and manner of marketing products, including advertisement
and sales promotion: however, these rules are now generally faced with
the Keck «certain selling arrangement» test, which we will see below, as
opposed to the Cassis de Dijon one. Finally, other measures — mainly
concerning authorizations and inspections (as such not clearly classifiable as
product requirements or selling arrangements) — were originally labelled as
indistinctly applicable measures: nevertheless, now they will likely undergo
the test pursuant to the /talian Trailers formula (which will be analyzed
below). Therefore, it now seems that the category of indistinctly applicable
measures is reduced to covering product requirements, to which the seminal
decision of Cassis de Dijon applies.

In fact, the Court ruled for the first time on an indistinctly applicable
measure in Rewe-Zentral AG v. Bundesmonopolverwaltung fur Branntwein
(Cassis de Dijon), Case 120/78. In the instant case, German law required
fruit liqueurs to possess at least 25% alcohol. Cassis de Dijon, a blackcurrant
liqueur, was made in France and typically contained less than 20% alcohol.
As a result, it could not be sold in Germany. A German importer, whom was
not granted authorization to import and sell Casszs, challenged this decision
on the basis that it contravened Article 34 TFEU.

The Court found that the application of product requirements to
imports hindered their importation and, therefore, such rules amounted
to MHEEs. However, the Court also clarified that the mere existence of
product requirements rules is not per se a problem; rather their application
to products imported from other Member States violates Article 34.

The trade-restricting effects of such application were dealt with by
the Court by developing two ideas (which would later reveal to be two of
the most important legal developments of EU law). The first is «mutual
recognition»: each Member State is indeed required to accept products
made according to the laws of other Member States as there is no reason
why such products should not be sold in all other Member States, if they
comply with the laws of the Member State where they are produced. The
Court therefore made a choice for regulation by the country of origin.

The second idea is that of «mandatory requirements. In the absence of

53
F. RAFFAELE

harmonization legislation, there may sometimes be a need for derogation
from the principle of mutual recognition, particularly when the application
of standards to imports serves the protection of important interests such as
effectiveness of fiscal supervision, the protection of public health, the fairness
of commercial transactions and the defense of consumer.

The list was further broadened in subsequent cases, and this category is
now considered to be open-ended. In such cases, there is therefore a balancing
process involved, in which proportionality is the central concept.

The legal status of these derogations is odd. Article 36 TFEU provides
for exceptions to Article 34 where necessary to protect substantial interests
such as public health or security. However, the Court in Cassis de Dijon
did not offer a broad interpretation of Article 36; rather, it created a new
category of exceptions, in addition to those provided for by the Treaty.
Whereas such exceptions cover a wider range of interest in respect of those
contemplated under Article 36, they only apply to indistinctly applicable
measures as the doctrine of mandatory requirements may not be invoked
where a measure discriminates directly.

Later in the jurisprudence of the Court, it was debated whether the
aforesaid “market circumstances” rules (z.e., rules concerning “who sells the
product, and when, where and how”) amounted to MHEEs and, as such,
were to be prohibited under Article 34 TFEU. In general terms, these rules
differ from MHEEs because they neither are designed nor have the effect to
protect the home market (discriminating against the imported products) as
well as because they typically affect the retailers and not the producers or the
importers. The Court oscillated between different approaches to “market
circumstances” rules: on the one hand, they were deemed as MHEEs,
albeit potentially justifiable, because of their restrictive effect on intra-EU
trade (see Criminal Proceedings against Oosthoeks Uitgeversmaatschappi BV,
Case 286/81, or Schuteverband gegen Unwesen in der Wirtschaft v. Yves
Rocher GmbH, Case C-126/91); on the other hand, they were considered
to fall outside Article 34 TFEU because they neither could generally be
considered as «trading rules» within the meaning of Dassonville nor had a
discriminatory effect affecting inter-State trade (see H. Krantz GmbH & Co.
v. Ontvanger der Directe Belastingen and Staat der Nederlanden, Case 69/88).
The most controversial approach to these rules was however that shown
by the Court in the Sunday trading cases (so called because the Court was
called upon to assess the compatibility with the Treaty of those laws that
required shops to be closed on Sundays, see Torfaen Borough v. B&Q, Case
C-145/88, or U.D.S. CGT de [Aisne v. Conforama; Criminal proceedings

54
THE FREE MOVEMENT OF Goops

against Marchandise, Joined Cases C-312 & 332/89) where it was unclear
whether the Court had adhered to its precedents following Cassis de Dijon or
had developed a new test for assessing the proportionality of the concerned
“market circumstances” rules adopted by Member States.

This eventually led to the decision of the Court in Criminal
Proceedings against Bernard Keck and Daniel Mithouard, Joined Cases
C-267 & 268/91. Here, Keck and Mithouard sold goods at a loss, that is
at a price below that which they had been purchased wholesale. This was
prohibited under French law. They argued that the foregoing represented
a method of sales promotion which would turn into a restriction of the
volume of sales of imported goods, and, therefore, the French ban was in
breach of Article 34 TFEU.

In rejecting Keck and Mithouard’s argument, the Court took the
opportunity to distinguish between «product requirements» and «certain selling
arrangements». Whereas in respect of the former the principles set out in Cassis
de Dijon should continue to apply, with regard to the latter the application
to products from other Member States of national provisions restricting or
prohibiting certain selling arrangements is not such as to hinder directly or
indirectly, actually or potentially, trade between Member States within the
meaning of the Dassonville judgment provided that provisions apply to all
affected traders operating within the national territory and provided that
they affect in the same manner, in law and in fact, the marketing of domestic
products and those from other Member States.

In other words, domestic provisions that restrict or prohibit altogether
«certain selling arrangements» do not breach Article 34 TFEU so long as
two conditions are satisfied: (z) the provisions apply to all affected traders
operating in the territory (so-called principle of universality), and (zz) the
provisions are not discriminatory in law and in fact (so-called principle
of neutrality, see Deutscher Apothekeverband v. 0800 DocMorris NV, Case
C-322/01). And the rationale of the foregoing is that, so long as the
aforesaid conditions are fulfilled, such rules do not prevent foreign goods
from accessing the domestic market nor do they impede access for foreign
products more than they impede access for domestic goods.

In light of the foregoing, the rules governing the way products are sold
are not MHEEs. Member States may therefore legislate on matters such as
prices, opening hours, sales techniques, and advertising, so long as these
rules do not discriminate against the marketing of foreign goods. As such,
while product requirements, irrespective of their discriminatory effect, fall

within the scope of Article 34 TFEU in line with the Cassis de Dijon test,

55
F. RAFFAELE

only discriminatory selling arrangements violate the Treaty provisions on
free movement of goods. Given the applicability of two different tests,
the distinction between product requirements and selling arrangements
has become the main issue in the post-Keck jurisprudence. Ultimately, for
non-discriminatory measures, this has turned into a dispute on whether the
national laws has classified the concerned measure as a product requirement
or not (see Familiapress v. Bauer Verlag, Case C-365/95). Therefore, by
way of examples, an Italian law requiring shops to be closed on Sundays
(see Punto Casa SpA v. Capena, Joined Cases C-69 & 258/93), a Greek
law prescribing that processed milk for infants be sold exclusively in
pharmacies (see Commission v. Greece, Case C-391/92), and an Austrian law
prohibiting the sale of certain products — including gold and silver jewelry
— at private homes (see A-Punkt Schmuckhandel v. Claudia Schmidt, Case
C-441/04) were all considered as selling arrangements. However, not every
selling arrangement is per se excluded from the scope of Article 34 TFEU;
rather, should a selling arrangement still bar non-domestic goods from
accessing the market, it would be considered in breach of Article 34 (see
Konsumentombudsmannen (KO) v. De Agostini (Svenska) Forlag AB, Joined
Cases C-34 & 35 & 36/95).

Product requirements and selling arrangements do not exhaust the category
of measures that may constitute MHEEs. Case law has preponderantly
focused on rules that interfered somehow with the commercial chain, from
production to trading until the selling of a good. Rules that limited the
consumer use of a good were long considered to fall outside the scope of
Article 34 TFEU.

The Court addressed this issue in Commission v. Italy Italian Trailers),
Case C-110/05. An Italian law provision prohibited the use of trailers
on motorcycles and mopeds: the question was therefore whether the
prohibition on using the trailers constituted or not a MHEE. Had the Keck
test been adopted by analogy, the Italian rule would have benefited from the
derogation to Article 34. Instead, the Court ruled that the Italian measure
constituted a MHEE because a prohibition on the use of a product in the
territory of a Member State has a considerable influence on the behavior of
the consumers, which, in its turn, affects the access of that product to the
market of that Member State.

The extension of the scope of Article 34 to national measures that
limit the use of a product by the final consumer was further confirmed
by the Court in Aklagaren v. Mickelsson and Roos, Case C-142/05. The

case concerned a Swedish rule that restricted the use of personal watercraft

56
THE FREE MOVEMENT OF Goops

(such as jet skis) on certain waterways, which was considered by the Court
as a MHEE on the basis of a rationale very similar to that adopted in
Italian Trailers, particularly noting that consumers, knowing that the use
of a certain product permitted by the concerned national measure is very
limited, have only a limited interest in buying that product.

Although Jtalian Trailers concerned a total prohibition on use, while
Mickelson regarded a mere restriction on the use of a product, both
decisions clearly express the Court’s preference for a market access test
rather than the more doctrinally opaque Keck test: there is no need to show
discrimination, yet the only concern is whether the national rules totally
or greatly prevent consumers from using goods lawfully produced in other
Member States. Should that be the case, the measure would hinder access
to the domestic market of such foreign product and, to this extent, would
amount to a breach of Article 34 TFEU.

Subsequent case law (see ANETT v. Administracién del Estado, Case
C-456/10) appeared to support the view of the Court on the market access
test. However, it is still unclear whether this new test also applies to selling
arrangements, thereby ultimately overturning Keck or, as it seems more
plausible, is confined to the “new” catch-all category that includes any
measure which cannot easily be classified as a distinctly applicable measure,
a product requirement, or a selling arrangement (see National Raid van

Dierenkwekers en Liethebbers VZW v. Belgische Staat, Case C-219/07).
5.3. Restrictions on Exports

While Article 34 TFEU deals with imports, Article 35 is applicable to
circumstances where Member States attempts to hinder the export of goods
to other Member States, but does not apply to exports to third countries.

The wording of Article 35 TFEU mirrors that of Article 34: as such,
it prohibits both quantitative restrictions on exports and measures having
an equivalent effect.

No particular issues arise in case of quantitative restrictions because, as
in the case of imports, they may be either quotas or total export prohibitions
for certain goods. In The Queen v. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,
ex p. Hedley Lomas (Ireland), Case C-5/94, the decision of the UK ministry
to refuse a company a license to export live sheep to Spain, as Spanish
slaughterhouses were considered not to fulfil EU standards, constituted a
breach of Article 35 TFEU.

On the contrary, Article 35 TFEU was deemed to slightly differ from

57
F. RAFFAELE

Article 34 in one specific respect, with regard to measures having equivalent
effects: while Article 34 TFEU prohibits both distinctly applicable (ze.,
discriminatory) and indistinctly applicable measures, Article 35 TFEU
would only ban discriminatory measures.

A measure within Article 35 must provide some specific disadvantage for
exports, by comparison with goods sold domestically, thereby encouraging
domestic sales at the expense of export sales. Indeed, this was the decision
of the Court in Groenveld v. Produktschap voor Vee en Vlees, Case 15/79:
a wholesaler of horsemeat had challenged the legality of a Dutch law
prohibiting the (industrial) production of horsemeat sausages. The law had
been adopted in order to protect Dutch meat exports in light of the fact
that the consumption of horsemeat was not allowed in the national markets
of some important trading partners. The Court held that such prohibition
did not constitute a measure having an equivalent effect because Article
35 TFEU concerns national measures which have as their specific object
or effect the restrictions patterns of exports and thereby the establishment
of a difference in treatment between the domestic trade of a Member State
and its export trade in such a way as to provide a particular advantage for
national production or for the domestic market of the State in question at
the expense of the production or of the trade of other Member States. This
is not so in the case of a prohibition like that in question which is applied
objectively to the production of goods of a certain kind without drawing a
distinction depending on whether such goods are intended for the national
market or for export.

The Groenveld three-tier test to establish a possible breach of Article 35
TFEU was much narrower than the homologous Dassonville one: in fact, unlike
Dassonville, the Groenveld test was conditional upon differential treatment and
the existence of a protectionist effect. The only exception concerned agricultural products, in which cases the Court has always applied the Dassonville
formula (see Kakavetsos-Fragkopoulos kai v. Korinthias, Case C-161/2009).

It took almost thirty years before the Court changed its approach,
which happened in Criminal proceedings against Lodewijk Gysbrechts
and Santurel Inter BVBA, Case C-205/07. The case concerned a Belgian
company which sold food supplements over the internet. Customers paying
by credit card had to provide its number and expiry date. According to
Belgian authorities, this resulted in a violation of a consumer protection
law provision, which prohibited the seller from requiring the consumer to
provide any form of payment before the expiry of the withdrawal period of
seven working days, because providing the credit card number enabled the

58
THE FREE MOVEMENT OF Goops

company to collect the price of the goods before the expiry of the period
for withdrawal. This rule applied without distinction to domestic sales as
well as exports. As an indistinctly applicable measure, this rule should have
been held outside the scope of Article 35 pursuant to Groenveld. However,
this rule was actually considered as a measure having equivalent effects
creating, as a matter of fact, disadvantages to the export of domestic sales
contrary to Article 35 TFEU: indeed, requiring the customers to pay
once they had received the goods and after the expiry of the withdrawal
period, creates a significant risk of non-payment, especially with regard to
customers residing in another Member State, considering the difficulties
in instigating legal proceeding in another country. This, in turn, implies a
more discouraging effect on sales abroad than domestic ones.

Article 35 TFEU therefore applies to all national measures which tend to
make export sales more burdensome than domestic sales, whether this is by
direct discrimination or simply as a matter of fact (see Criminal proceedings
against Marco Grilli, Case C-12/02). However, alike Article 34, equally
applicable measures hindering exports may be justified either by invocation
of the explicit derogations listed in Article 36 TFEU or if they are necessary
to meet some mandatory requirement (and are proportionate).

5.4. Justifications

National measures that are quantitative restrictions or measures having
equivalent effects are prohibited under EU law, unless they can be justified.
There are two types of justifications: firstly, the Treaty-based justifications
under Article 36 TFEU; and, secondly, other justificatory grounds based on
the Court's case law, alternatively called “mandatory requirements’, “imperative
requirements” or “overriding reasons relating to the public interest”. Both
categories of justifications are subject to the proportionality requirement.

Article 36 TFEU expressly exempts national laws that hinder the free
movement of goods on the following grounds: () public morality, public
policy or public security; (zz) protection of health and life of humans, animals
or plants; (zz) protection of national treasures possessing artistic, historic or
archaeological value; or (zv) protection of industrial and commercial property.

The Court has imposed two constraints on Member States’ freedom
to invoke the foregoing derogations. First, Article 36 must be interpreted
strictly and the list contemplated thereunder is to be intended as exhaustive.
The exceptions cannot be extended to cases other than those specifically laid
down (see Commission v. Ireland (Irish Souvenirs), Case 113/80). Second, the

59
F. RAFFAELE

derogations cannot be used to serve economic objectives (see Commission v,
Italy, Case 7/61).

In addition, Article 36 TFEU provides that such restrictions must not
«constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade».
The first prong of this formula is an objective requirement: the differentiation
between imported and domestic goods must be based on objective grounds.
The second prong is basically a prohibition of protectionism: the negative
effect on trade must be as limited as possible and, in any case, must be incidental effect and not the main purpose of the domestic measure. The burden of
proof is on the national authorities to demonstrate in each case that their rules
are necessary to give effective protection to the interests referred to in Article 36
TFEU (see Criminal proceedings against Leendert van Bennekom, Case 227/82).

Article 36 applies (z) to both import and export restrictions; (2) to
both quantitative restrictions and measures having an equivalent effect;
and (272) to distinctly and indistinctly applicable measures.

Despite limiting the scope of Article 36, since Cassis de Dijon the Court has
allowed for implied derogations to such provision: the part of this decision on
mutual recognition led to the conclusion that Article 34 TFEU was to outlaw
all non-discriminatory obstacles to trade resulting from national disparities
in product requirements. To compensate the States for the widened scope of
Article 34, the Court enlarged the scope of possible justifications, even though
the Court has repeatedly confirmed that mandatory requirements apply
only to indistinctly applicable measures (see Commission v. Belgium (Walloon
waste), Case C-2/90).

In Cassis de Dijon, the Court gave a non-exhaustive list of examples for
these mandatory requirements (including the effectiveness of fiscal supervision,
the protection of public health, the fairness of commercial transactions and the
defense of consumer). From that time onward, the Member States brought
forward a large number of mandatory requirements, many of which the Court
has accepted provided that (z) they are unrelated to the origin of the goods; (z1)
they serve objectives considered by the Court to be legitimate; and (zzz) there is
evidence that they genuinely serve the purposes for which they are intended (see
Commission v. Belgium (automatic fire detection systems), Case C-254/05).

Finally, like derogations contemplated under Article 36 TFEU, mandatory
requirement are available only in the absence of harmonization EU legislation
(see ANETT v. Administracién del Estado, Case C-456/10).

They can be considered as the functional equivalent of the concept of
objective justification developed in the context of indirectly discriminatory
national taxes under Article 110 TFEU.

60
THE FREE MOVEMENT OF Goops

National measures that are justifiable either under Article 36 TFEU or
as mandatory requirements must be proportionate. The proportionality
requirement is essentially a three-pronged test. First, the national measure
must be suitable or appropriate to achieve the intended goal (see WV United
Foods and PVBA v. Belgium, Case 132/80). Second, the measure must be
necessary, meaning that it must not go beyond what is necessary to achieve
the intended outcomes. In other words, not only there should not be other
less restrictive means of producing the same effect, but also, even if there are
no such less restrictive means, the measure should not have an excessive effect
on the interests concerned (see Rosengren v. Riksaklagaren, Case C-170/04).
Finally, the measure must be proportionate stricto sensu, meaning that its
positive effects must outweigh its negative effects (see Commission v. Germany
(pharmacies for hospitals), Case C-141/07). However, the Court often reduces
this test to an analysis of the «necessity prong and rules that the public
interest pursued must not be attainable by measures which are less restrictive
of such trade (see Aher- Waggon GmbH v. Germany, Case C-389/96).

The national authorities bear the burden of proof to demonstrate that
their measures fulfil the proportionality requirements

Abstract

Chapter 2 is concerned with the free movement of goods. This can be
impeded in different ways. The most obvious form of protectionism is customs
duties, or charges having an equivalent effect, to make foreign goods more
expensive than their domestic counterparts. This is dealt with by Articles 28-30
TFEU. A Member State may also attempt to benefit domestic goods by taxes that
discriminate against imported goods. This is covered by Articles 110-113 TFEU.
Finally, a Member State may seek to preserve advantages for its own goods by
imposing quotas or measures which have an equivalent effect on imports, thereby

reducing imported products. This is dealt with in Articles 34-37 TFEU.

1. Introduction

The whole EU regulation of the free movement of persons shows a
common fundamental purpose, which may be found in the aim of ensuring
the actual free circulation within the Internal Market of those persons who
live in (and are citizens of ) the Member States, and has its foundation in the
key principle of the prohibition of discriminations based on the nationality
(Article 18 TFEU).

It is worth noting that the Rome Treaties, under their initial structure,
have not been concerning the person as such and as citizen, but rather the
person as individual who exercises an activity with economic effects and,
at most, the persons related (typically, for family connections) to such
economical actors. Hence, the first European regulations have been solely
referring to movements within the Member States’ territories which showed
to have a given economical significance.

Over the years, even before the entry into force of the Maastricht
Treaty, the European case law and statutory framework have been then
progressively extending, with a step-by-step approach, the scope of the
right of free movement to all persons who are citizens of a Member State,
regardless of the exercise of an economical activity, and turned to recognise
the “independence” of the freedom at stake from any employment or
commercial boundary.

1.1. Free Movement of Employees

The freedom of movement of employees was recognised by Article 48
of the Rome Treaty of 1957, which stated that such freedom of movement
had to be secured by the end of the transitional period.

The principle of free movement of employees started, then, to be
implemented already during said transitional period.

The first European regime was estabilished by the Council Regulation
(EEC) 15/1961, which essentially granted the citizens of the Member States
the right to hold an employment position in the territory of a different
Member State in those cases where such job could not be assigned to a local
“adequate” employee (see Article 1).

Therefore, such Council Regulation sanctioned the key (and still
discriminatory) principle of the priority of the national employees. The
second limitation posed to the right of free movement of employees was,
then, given by the requirement of a work permit for all the employees
coming from a different Member State (see Article 6).

In any case, notwithstanding the above limitations to the access to the
job market, the Regulation at stake ensured, for the first time, the same
treatment to the other Member States’ employees with respect to their
compensation, work conditions and trade unions’ rights in the hosting
Member States.

The second phase of the process of implementation of the freedom at
stake occurred with the Council Regulation (EEC) 38/1964.

On the one hand, such Regulation broadened the range of the employees
who could benefit from the right of free movement and included certain
categories of employees who had been previously excluded (such as the
seasonal workers). It also sanctioned the applicability of its rules to the
employees who moved to a different Member State in dependence of the
exercise by their employer of the right of free provision of services.

On the other hand, more significantly, the Council Regulation (EEC)
38/1964 repealed the principle of priority of the national employees and
introduced the opposite and fundamental principle of the priority of the
European market employees (Article 1).

However, according to said Regulation, all Member States retained
the right to suspend the freedom of movement of the employees within
a given region or with respect to certain activities in case of “overload” of
workforce (Article 2).

The full implementation of the freedom of movement of employees

70
FREE MOVEMENT OF PERSONS

was, finally, achieved with the Council Directive 68/360/EEC and the
Council Regulation (EEC) 1612/1968: in particular, the Council Directive
repealed all the limitations to the entry and residence of the employees and
their families in the other Member States, while the Council Regulation was
essentially aimed at fully implementing the freedom of movement of the
employees within the European Union and sanctioned, amongst others, the
principle of the equality of treatment between the national employees and
the other Member States’ employees.

In a nutshell, since the end of the transitional period, no discriminatory
measure based on nationality requirements has been allowed with respect to
the subordinate employment relationship and the above mentioned Council
Directive and Regulation have been overseeing the matter at stake for about
40 years.

As of today, Articles 45-48 TFEU govern the free movement of the
EU employees and, at the same time, the “historical” Council Regulation

(EEC) 1612/1968 has been replaced by the Regulation (EU) 492/2011.
1.2. Free Movement of Citizens

As anticipated, the right of free movement of persons has been initially
conceived as a mere economical right. The purpose of extending the “scope”
of such right has been, then, deeply pursued by both the European Court of
Justice and the European legislator.

On the one hand, the EC] has been extending the range of persons who
could be entitled to benefit from the free movement within the European
Union, overriding the “typical” cases provided for by the European statutory
framework (essentially given by the free movement of employees referred
to above, by the right of establishment as well as by the right of free provision of services). Such scope has been pursued firstly by interpreting in the
broadest manner the categories of persons expressly listed in the European
Treaties and, secondly, by introducing other categories of individuals who
were not expressly mentioned therein (see § 2.1 below). In this respect, for
instance, the mere search for a job in another Member State has been recognised to fall within the scope of Article 45 TFEU (see § 2.2 below).

On the other hand, over the decades, the European legislator gradually
granted all the European Union citizens a “general” right of movement
and residence, although under given restrictions. Also the EU legislator
has been, therefore, unfastening the boundaries of the free movement’ right,
releasing the latter from the employment activity “essential requirement”.

71
F. PALMIERI

In such perspective, the EU statutory framework went through a significant development at the beginning of the ‘90 years, when the European

Council enacted three Directives and more in detail:

a) the Council Directive 90/364/EEC on the right of residence of

the citizens other than employees;

b) the Council Directive 90/365/EEC on the right of residence of
the employees and self-employed persons who have ceased their
activity; and

c) the Council Directive 90/366/EEC on the right of residence
of students (see Grzelczyk, case C-184/99) (such Directive was
subsequently deemed to be void by the EC) for violation of the
European Parliament competences and replaced by the Council

Directive 93/96/EEC).

Through the Directives above listed, the right of residence and free
movement of the persons was significantly extended, making it essentially
conditional to the enjoyment of a sufficient income or pension and to the
possession of an illness insurance.

The above statutory trend found its “blessing” in the Maastricht Treaty,
which, in “connection” with the key concept of the European citizenship,
introduced the Article which, still as of today, represents the key rule in the
matter at stake, ze. Article 21 TFEU (previously Article 18 (1) TCE).

Article 21 TFEU sanctions the right of each citizen of the Member States
to freely move and reside within the entire territory of the Union, without
any reference, any more, to the economic “value” of the activities carried out.

More recently, all the Directives above referred have been replaced by
the Directive 2004/38/EC, which has been called to rationalize the previous
EU statutory framework and, as of today, governs (within a consolidated
act) the freedom of movement and residence of the European Citizens
and of their relatives in the whole territory of the Union. More in detail,
said Directive definitively implements the right of residence, also with an
indefinite duration, of all the EU citizens who prove to comply with certain
requirements (in particular, the possession of sufficient economical resources
and of an illness insurance) (see § 3.2 below).

As a final remark, Article 21 TFEU, along with the Directive 2004/38/
EC, sanctioned the definitive overruling of the previous “commercial
approach” to the right of movement of the persons within the European
Union territory. Hence, Europe moved from the freedom of movement of

72
FREE MOVEMENT OF PERSONS

economical actors (employees and self-employed persons) to the freedom
of movement of Citizens (see, amongst others, Baumbast, case C-413/99).

2. The Freedom of Movement of the Employees

The right of free movement of the employees within the EU territory
is sanctioned, as of today, by Articles 45-48 TFEU.

In particular, the leading Article 45 TFUE states that:

1. Freedom of movement for workers shall be secured within
the Union.

2. Such freedom of movement shall entail the abolition of
any discrimination based on nationality between workers of
the Member States as regards employment, remuneration
and other conditions of work and employment.

[...]

Article 45 is a rule having direct effects (Van Duyn, case 41/74; Watson
and Belmann, case 118/75; Terhoeve, case C-18/95) and the employees are
entitled to challenge, in front of the courts or authorities of the relevant
Member State, the illegitimacy of any discrimination impairing their
access to the work, the employment conditions, the social security and
insurance terms and any other phase of the employment relationship.
The same rights as well as the existence of discriminatory measures may
be invoked also by the employers who, for instance, encounter difficulties
in hiring employees of different Member States due to national laws or
regulations (see Clean Car Autoservice, case C-350/96).

As anticipated, Articles 45 and following TFEU are now “implemented”
by the Regulation (EU) 492/2011.

2.1. The Employee

The persons who may benefit from the freedom at stake are the
“employees”.
In this respect, it is crucial noting that, absent a definition of employee

73
F. PALMIERI

within the Treaties and the EU legislation, the relevant notion (as well as
the concept of subordinate employment activity) must be autonomously
construed, pursuant to the EU laws and case law, and cannot be interpreted,
in any case, in a restrictive manner (Lawrie-Blum, case 66/85; Kempf, case
139/85; Meeusen, case C-337/97; Collins, case C-138/02). A different
approach, leaving the determination of such notions to each Member
State, would seriously risk to allow the latter to “unilaterally” exclude given
categories of persons from the scope of the EU freedom at stake (Unger, case
75/63; Levin, case 53/81; Bettray, case 344/87).

The EU notion of employee is deemed to be satisfied when three
conditions are met (see Martinez Sala, case C-85/96; Rundgren, case
C-389/99).

Firstly, the person must be a citizen of a Member State.

However, it must be noted that, pursuing the scope of safeguarding the fundamental (and prevailing) right of integrity of the family, the
requirement of the EU citizenship does not apply to the members of the
family of the employee who are non-EU citizens: indeed, such persons
may benefit from the right of free movement and residence as long as
they are part of the family of an EU citizen employee and regardless of
their citizenship (see, amongst others, Singh, case C-370/90; Diatta, case
267/83; see also Directive 2004/38/EC and § 3.2 below).

Secondly, the working activity must be carried out within a Member
State other than the home Member State of the employee.

It follows that the working relationship must be localized, in any case,
within the territory of the European Union or must show, at least, a strong
connection with same territory. In this respect, the EC] recognised the
occurrence of such requirement even in cases where the citizen of a Member
State was required to perform his activity on the ship of a different Member
State (Lopes de Veiga, case 9/88) or the activity was carried out outside the
EU territory in secondment regime (Prodest, case 237/83; Boukhalfa, case
C-214/94).

As a further consequence, the regulations governing the free movement are
not applicable to cases which are merely “located” within a single Member
State, without any connection with one or more different Member States,
and are therefore purely national (The Queen vs. Vera Ann Saunders,
case 175/78; Hans Moser vs. Land Baden-Wiirttemberg, case 180/83;
Steen I, case C-332/90; Kapasakalis and others, joined cases C-225/95,
C-266/95 and C-227/95). Hence, also cases of discrimination vis-a-vis
the citizens of the Member State itself could occur (so-called “inverse”

74
FREE MOVEMENT OF PERSONS

discriminatory cases); in such circumstances, these cases could be solved out
through the application of the national laws safeguarding the principle of equal
treatment (Steen IT, case C-132/93). On the other hand, it is worth noting
that the principles concerning the freedom of movement of employees must be
necessarily applied when the employee exercised his/her right of movement and,
being back in the home Member State, requests to benefit from rights equivalent
to those granted in the Member State of residence (Singh, case C-370/90).

The third condition required to apply the freedom of movement of the
employees lies in the subordinate nature of the activity, which typically occurs
(applying the notion offered, over the decades, by the EU case law) when a
person works, for a given time period, in favour of a different person and
under the supervision of the latter against the payment of a compensation,
regardless of the industry where the activity is performed and of the nature
of the legal relationship between the employee and the employer (LawrieBlum, case 66/85; Brown, case 197/86; Asscher, case C-107/94; Collins, case
C-138/02; M. Trojani vs. CPAS, case C-456/02; Petersen, case C-228/07).
Moreover, it is required that the activities performed by the employee are
actual and true (see Ninni-Orasche, case C-413/01), being excluded from
the scope of the freedom of movement those activities which are, in
essence, merely ancillary and marginal.

As to the above requirements, pursuing the scope of the broadest
application of the freedom at stake, the ECJ admitted the qualification as
employment activity in several debatable cases, such as in case of:

a) activities with a reduced working time which granted the relevant
person with a compensation lower than the minimum subsistence
level (Levin, case 53/81; see also Bernini, case C-3/90; Raulin, case

C-357/89 and Hava Genc vs. Land Berlin, case C-14/09);

b) a professional internship carried out against a consideration
(regardless of the circumstance that the internship could be
deemed to be a mere training in view of the performance of a true
and actual exercise of the relevant profession) (Lawrie-Blum, case

66/85; Kraneman, case C-109/04);

c) activities performed for a religious community from its members,
provided that the services granted by the community to its members
could be deemed as to be the consideration, even if indirect, of true
and actual working activities (Steyman, case 196/87); while, on the
contrary, activities which are solely an instrument of re-integration
or rehabilitation of the relevant persons cannot be qualified as
employment activities (Bettray, case 344/87);

75
F. PALMIERI

d) activities whose compensation was entirely paid through public
funds for the re-integration to job of unemployed persons (/V.
Birden vs. Stadtgemeinde Bremen, case C-1/97);

e) an employment relationship with an international organization
(Echternach and others, joined cases 389/87 and 390/87); and even

in case of

f) awork performed by the wife of the sole owner of the relevant

enterprise (Meeusen, case C-337/97).

More in general, the notion of economical activity required for the
qualification as employment activity has been extended by the ECJ as
to deem irrelevant both the limited level of compensation as well as the
source of the resources for the payment of such compensation (Bettray,
case 344/87; Kurz, case C-188/02; M. Trojani vs. CPAS, case C-456/02).
Furthermore, the applicability of the rules on the freedom of movement
does not require the relevant beneficiary to be qualified as employee in
the home Member State, as such person may be an autonomous worker
or even an unemployed person in such State; on the contrary, it is crucial
that the movement to a different Member States is carried out in order to
access an employment activity (see Article 1, Regulation (EU) 492/2011).

Finally, also the sport activity has been deemed to fall within the scope of
the EU regime on the free movement of employees, on the assumption that
this is an economical activity pursuant to the Treaties (Walrave, case 36/74;
Bosman, case C-415/93; Angonese, case C-281/98; Casteels, case C-379/09;
see also Dona v. Mantero, case 13/76; Deliége, case C-51/96 and C-191/97
and Meca-Medina and Majcen v. Commission, cases C-313/02 and C-519/04).
In this respect, the EC] stated that, when a sport activity has the nature of a
subordinate employment activity or of a provision of services, as it occurs in
the case of the activity performed by professional or semi-professional sport
persons, then it falls within the scope of Articles 45 and following or Articles
56 and following TFUE (Olympique Lyonnais, case C-325/08).

2.2. The Employees Rights

Article 45 TFEU provides for a (non exhaustive) list of the rights
which are granted to the employees who benefit from the freedom of
movement within the EU:

3. [The free movement of employees] shall entail the right,
subject to limitations justified on grounds of public order,

76
FREE MOVEMENT OF PERSONS

public security or public health:
(a) to accept offers of employment actually made;

(b) to move freely within the territory of Member States for
this purpose;

(c) to stay ina Member State for the purpose of employment
in accordance with the provisions governing the employment
of nationals of that State laid down by law, regulation or
administrative action;

(d) to remain in the territory of a Member State after having
been employed in that State, subject to conditions which
shall be embodied in regulations to be drawn up by the
Commission

[...]

The EU employees actually benefit from a statutory regime (governed
by Article 45 and following TFEU and by the Regulation (EU) 492/2011)
which translates into a significant number of rights whose scope and content
has been strengthened, over the decades, by the European case law.

Such rights concern, in particular, the access to work and the exercise of
the working activity.

The conditions of access to work are the first matter as to which no
discriminatory measure, and in particular no criteria of priority of the
national employees, may be applied (Articles 1 and 3, Regulation (EU)
492/2011). In particular, such Regulation clarifies that all the laws and
regulations which make access to work of the other Member States’
employees conditional upon terms that are not applicable to the national
employees as well as all the laws and regulations which (even if applicable
regardless of the nationality) have as scope or as exclusive or main effect
the exclusion of the employees of other Member States from certain job
offers are completely ineffective.

The leading case lies in Commission of the European Communities vs.
France (case 167/73), where the ECJ ruled that the French laws (in particular,
the Code du travail maritime) which reserved to the national citizens a certain
percentage of the crew of the mercantile ships under the French flag were in
clear violation of the principle of freedom of movement of the employees and
of the prohibition of discriminations for nationality grounds.

As to the “meaning” of access to work, it must be highlighted that the
regime of the free movement of the employees not only applies to those

77
F. PALMIERI

individuals who move to a different Member State to accept an actual and
specific job offer, but also to the individuals who move searching for a
job in another Member State. Indeed, since its first judgements, the EC]
recognized the right of the EU citizens to reside in a different Member
State in order to search for a job, also in the absence of an actual job offer
(Royer, case 48/75; Levin, case 53/81; Lair, case 39/86; Sala, case C-85/96;
Rundgren, case C-389/99). Such right has been granted on the ground that
the scope of the freedom of movement would risk to be seriously impaired
if the individuals were not allowed to search job offers in the territory of
the other Member States. Hence, it is necessary that the EU legislation
or (absent any EU rule) the laws of the single Member States set forth
a reasonable term that allows the EU citizens to look for and assess the
existing offers in the territory of the relevant hosting Member State and to
perform any and all the activities necessary to be hired (see Commission vs.
Belgium, case C-344/95, where it has also been stated that, in any case, if
the relevant persons demonstrate that they are continuing to search for a
job and that they have concrete possibilities to be hired, then they cannot
be obliged to leave the territory of the hosting Member State even if the
reasonable “national” term for the job research has expired).

The matter of access to work could also be subject to “hidden” or indirect
discriminatory measures, 7.e. measures which (even if applicable to all the
employees, both national and from other Member States) de facto turn to be
a discrimination for the latter: such discriminatory measures are absolutely
banned as well.

In this respect, the EU case law has been sanctioning, over the years,
several discriminatory requirements, such as the residence requirement,
the condition of the knowledge of the local language (Gvoener, case
C-379/87) as well as the possession of specific qualifications (O'Flynn, case
C-237/94; Meints, case C-57/96).

Similarly, also the laws and regulations governing the economical
relationships amongst the employers in a certain industry may constitute
restrictions to the access to the relevant work so long as they impair the
terms and conditions of hiring of the employees, for instance setting forth
economical burdens upon the employer who intends to hire an employee
coming from a different Member State: in such perspective, in the Bosman,
case C-415/93, the EC] stated that the regulations governing the transfer
of football players from a soccer company to another, even if they concern
the economical relationships between the companies (and not the employment relationship between the football companies and the players), affect

78
FREE MOVEMENT OF PERSONS

(through the obligation upon football companies to pay indemnities when
they hire players coming from other companies) the possibility of the
employees (z.e. of the football players) to find a job as well as the economical conditions of such job and are, therefore, in breach of the EU principle
of free movement of employees. In the same perspective, the EC] stated
that, for the purposes of the professional experience required for a public
contest, also the past experience performed in the public administration
of the home Member State must be necessarily taken into consideration
and duly assessed (Commission vs. Greece, case C-187/96; see also Usgliola,
case 15/69 and Scholz, case C-419/92) and that, conversely, a national
collective bargaining agreement which sets forth a career path based on
the seniority and does not take into consideration the working activities
carried out in another Member State is in violation of Article 45 TFEU
(Schoenig-Kougebetopoulou, case C-15/96).

Once the employees acceded the job market of the hosting Member
State, they must benefit from the right to perform their activity pursuant
to the same conditions granted to the national employees.

The principle of prohibition of discrimination applies, therefore, also
to any and all the conditions of exercise of the working activity (Allué v.
University of Venice, case 33/88). Such conditions concern the compensation
(see Kobler vs. Republic Osterreich, case C-224/01), the professional training,
the unemployment status, the termination of the relationship and, more in
general, the whole regime of the employment relationship.

In this respect, Article 7(4) of the Regulation (EU) 492/2011 sanctions,
as a general rule, the voidness of all the clauses, provided for by national
collective bargaining agreements or by individual employment contracts,
which set forth or allow a discriminatory treatment for employees coming
from other Member States (see Sotgiu, case 152/73; Walrave, case 36/74;
Olympique Lyonnais, C-325/08).

As to the conditions of the working activity, specific attention is paid
to the matters of social and tax benefits and trade unions’ rights.

Regulation (EU) 492/2011 specifies that all social and tax benefits
granted to the national employees must be applied, as such, also to the
employees of the other Member States (Article 7(2)).

The EC] applied such principle in several occasions, such as, for
instance, to the reduction of train rates for families with several sons
(Cristini, case 32/75), the benefits for descendants and forefathers depending
on the employee (Castelli, case 261/83; Meeusen, case C-337/97), the
unemployment indemnity for young individuals looking for their first job

79
F. PALMIERI

(Deak, case 94/84), the protection measures in case of dismissal for serious
working inability (Marsman, case 44/72) and even the use of a different
language during a legal proceeding when same right was granted to a national
linguistic community (Muztsch, case 137/84).

In other words, the ECJ offered a broad and substantive interpretation
of Article 7(2) of the above Regulation (EU) 492/2011, applying the right
to benefit from all the social and tax “advantages” of the national employees
also to those benefits which are not related to the contractual regime of
the employment relationship, but are linked to the status of employee and
resident person. In this respect, the EU case law stated that the notion of
social benefits covers all those benefits which (related or unrelated to an
employment agreement) are generally granted to the national employees in
relation to their qualification as employees or to the mere circumstance of
their residence in the national territory and whose extension to the employees
coming from other Member States is susceptible to facilitate their right of free
movement within the territory of the Union (Martinez Sala, case C-85/96; see
also Pubblico ministero vs. Gilberto Even and ONPTS, case 207/78). Hence,
the employees of other Member States are granted the enjoyment of services
conferred, for different titles, by national public entities, regardless of the
terms of the relevant employment agreement (see F Reina and L. Reina vs.
Landeskreditbank Baden-Wiirttemberg, case 65/81).

The Regulation (EU) 492/2011 specifically applies the principle of equal
treatment also with respect to the trade unions’ rights and, in particular, with
reference to the registration with the local trade unions and the exercise of all
the relevant rights (Article 8) (see Rutili, case 36/75).

The possibility to include within the unions’ rights also the right
to hold executive offices in the relevant organizations had been initially
debated, but a specific European regulation (Council Regulation (EEC)
312/1976) finally sanctioned the right of the employee of a different
Member State to access also the executive offices of the trade unions of the
hosting Member State (see now Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 492/2011).

Finally, specific rights are granted by Article 45(3)(d) TFEU and by
Directive 2004/38/EC to the employees (and also to their relatives) with respect
to the period following the termination of their employment relationship.

In addition to the right of permanent residence in the hosting Member
State conferred to the EU citizens and their relatives who have been residing
on a continuous basis in such State for at least five years (see § 3.2 below),
the same right of permanent residence is granted to the employees in certain
specific cases also prior to the elapse of the above 5-year term (Article 17,

80
FREE MOVEMENT OF PERSONS

Directive 2004/38/EC). In particular, the right of permanent residence is
recognised to the employees who (i) have reached the pension age in the
hosting Member State, (ii) have suffered from a permanent working inability after having been residing for at least two years in the hosting State or (iii)
after three years of residence and working activity in the hosting Member
State, start to carry out a working activity in a different Member State, but
continue to reside in the hosting Member State or go back to such State at
least once a week.

In the above cases, the right of permanent residence (acquired by the
relevant employees) also extends to the relatives living with them, regardless
of their citizenship. Moreover, the family members (falling within the scope
of Regulation (EU) 492/2011) benefit from the right to remain within the
territory of the hosting Member State also after the death of the employee
who had accrued the right to reside therein after the termination of the
employment relationship (Article 12(1), Directive 2004/38/EC).

In addition to the right of permanent residence, further rights are
granted with respect to specific cases of termination of the employment
relationship. On the one hand, if the termination is due to dismissal, the
employee of a different Member State has the right to be provided with
the same assistance that the authorities of the State where he/she has
been working provide to the national citizens who are looking for a new
employment. On the other hand, if the termination of the employment
relationship is due to the inability of the employee or to the accrual of a
given seniority time or to the achievement of the limits of the working
age, then the employee has the right to benefit from the same pension
and social security regime set forth by the national laws and regulations
(provided that the relevant conditions listed in the applicable European
social security regulations are met).

2.3. The Family Members Rights

The exercise of the freedom of movement of the employees within the
EU territory would turn to be actually ineffective if it was not “combined”
with certain rights conferred also to the family’s members of the employee.
Indeed, the EU legislation has always been driven by the principle of the
highest protection of the family ties also with respect to the case of free
movement of employees.

As of today, the Regulation (EU) 492/2011 and the Directive
2004/38/EC grant to the spouse of the employee and to the sons up to 21

81
F. PALMIERI

years old or still dependent on the employee and, more in general, to the
relatives of the latter a number of rights aimed at preserving the family’s
unity (for the notion of relatives see § 3.2 below).

In particular, firstly, also the relatives of the employee benefit from the
right to reside and carry out a working activity in the hosting Member
State (Royer, case 48/75; MRAX, case C-459/99; see also Diatta, case
267/83 and Eyiip, case C-65/98).

Secondly, the sons of the employee enjoy the same benefits provided
for by the laws and regulations of the hosting Member State with respect
to the education of the national citizens (Article 10, Regulation (EU)
492/2011; previously, Article 12, Council Regulation (EEC) 1612/1968).
The interpretation of such rules by the EC] has been quite broad, as typically
occurred in the matter at stake: therefore, the concept of education has been
deemed to include, for instance, also scholarships and other measures of
support aimed at the professional training and at the academic studies and has
been applied also to cases of scholarships granted to the sons of the employee
to attend courses in another Member State and even in the Member State
where the employee came from (Di Leo, case C-308/89 and Echternach and
others, joined cases 389/87 and 390/87).

2.4. Social Security Regime

The EU regulations governing the social security regime of the employees
who exercise the freedom of movement are a key condition to fully ensure the
actual and due exercise of same freedom.

Without an adequate regime governing such matter, the EU employees
would seriously risk to be deprived of the social security rights ensured by
a given national legislation and/or of the relevant rights already accrued in
the home Member State (Lepore and Scamuffa, joined cases C-45/92 and
C-46/92). This would certainly impair and, in certain cases, even prevent
the exercise of the freedom of movement of employees.

The key section of the TFEU governing the social security matter lies
in Article 48, which reads as follows:

1. The European Parliament and the Council shall [...] adopt
such measures in the field of social security as are necessary
to provide freedom of movement for workers; to this end,
they shall make arrangements to secure for employed and
self-employed migrant workers and their dependants:

82
FREE MOVEMENT OF PERSONS

(a) aggregation, for the purpose of acquiring and retaining
the right to benefit and of calculating the amount of benefit,
of all periods taken into account under the laws of the several
countries;

(b) payment of benefits to persons resident in the territories
of Member States.

[...]

Article 48 TFEU, which does not have direct effects (Casteels, case
C-379/09), has been implemented, in particular, by Regulation (EC)
883/2004 (as amended by Regulations (EC) 988/2009 and 1231/2010
and by Regulation (EC) 987/2009).

It is preliminary worth noting that the above Regulations are not aimed
at establishing a “common” social security system for all the Member States,
but at supporting the coordination amongst the different national laws
and regulations, in order to allow the employees exercising the freedom of
movement to continue benefiting from the social security services accrued
over the years. Such outcome is essentially achieved through the aggregation
of all the accrued insurance periods. As a consequence, still today each
Member State continues to autonomously govern its own social security
system and the relevant rights and benefits.

More in detail, Regulation (EC) 883/2004 applies to the employees
(and also to the self-employed workers) who are (or have been) subject
to the legislation of one or more Member States and are EU citizens as
well as to their relatives and successors (see, for the past, Kermaschek, case
40/76; Cabanis-Issarte, case C-308/93 and Ruhr, case C-189/00). Most
significantly, such Regulation also applies to the public employees and to
the retired individuals.

The above Regulation covers all the “typical” areas of the social security
and, namely, the sickness benefits, the maternity and equivalent paternity
benefits, the invalidity assistance, the old age assistance, the survivors’ benefits,
the assistance with respect to accidents at work and occupational diseases, the
death grants, the unemployment assistance, the pre-retirement benefits and
the family benefits (Article 3(1)) Regulation (EC) 883/2004).

Moreover, the Regulation also covers all the social security schemes,
general and special, whether contributory or non-contributory, provided
that they are related to the above mentioned risks (Article 3(2)). On the
other hand, the areas of the social and medical assistance are out of the

scope of such Regulation (Article 3(5)).

83
F. PALMIERI

The coordination achieved through the Regulation (EC) 883/2004
is based on three fundamental principles: (i) the equality of treatment
between the employees who benefit from the freedom of movement and
the “national” employees; (ii) the identification of the applicable law and
(iii) the aggregation of the insurance periods.

The principle of equality of treatment, sanctioned by Article 4 of the above
Regulation, is the key principle also in the social security matter. Therefore, the
Member States are called to remove any and all the discriminatory measures
and, in particular, those commonly based on the residence requirement
(Article 7) (see Maris, case 55/77).

As to the identification of the applicable law (governed by Articles 11-16
of the above Regulation), the principle here is that the law applicable to the
matter at stake should be only one, which is given by the law of the State
where the working activity is performed, regardless of the place of residence
of the employee. However, there are certain exceptions to such choice-oflaw principle, which mainly apply to cases of secondments, to the employees
working in the international transportation industry and to the employees
working in two or more Member States (see Bentzinger, case 73/72 and
Foot-Ball Club d’Andlau, case 8/75).

The third key and more significant principle lies in the aggregation
of all the insurance periods, which grants to the employee who has been
subject to the laws of two or more Member States the right to aggregate the
insurance periods accrued pursuant to the laws of each of the relevant States
(Petroni, case 24/75). It follows that a strong cooperation between the public
administrations of the relevant Member States is necessary in order to fully
and duly implement such principle. It is worth noting that the aggregation
of periods is carried out in those cases where the application of just one
legislation would not grant to the employee the right to entirely or partially
benefit from the relevant social security scheme, as such employee has not
accrued enough insurance periods or as such periods would provide him/
her with social security benefits lower that the maximum applicable.

Finally, it should be also noted that the Lisbon Treaty added a final provision to Article 48 TTFEU, which risks to seriously weaken the entire social
security statutory framework.

Indeed, as of today, Article 48(2) states that:

2. Where a member of the Council declares that a draft
legislative act referred to in the first subparagraph would
affect important aspects of its social security system,

84
FREE MOVEMENT OF PERSONS

including its scope, costs or financial structure, or would
affect the financial balance of that system, it may request that
the matter be referred to the European Council. In that case,
the ordinary legislative procedure shall be suspended.

After discussion, the European Council shall, within four
months of this suspension, either:

(a) refer the draft back to the Council, which shall terminate
the suspension of the ordinary legislative procedure; or

(b) take no action or request the Commission to submit a
new proposal; in that case, the act originally proposed shall
be deemed not to have been adopted.

It follows that each Member State is actually granted the right to
suspend the relevant legislative process when it deems that a proposal in
the social security matter is susceptible to impair, in particular, the financial
structure of its national social security framework. This power will certainly
need to be exercised carefully by the Member States as to avoid a continuous
impasse of the development of the social security EU legislation.

2.5. Free Movement Restrictions

Pursuant to the EU legislation, the freedom of movement of employees
may be subject to restrictions in two different cases: with respect to
employments in the public administration or when grounds of public order,
public safety or public health occur.

Firstly, Article 45(4) TFEU states that the entire regime governing the
free movement of employees does not apply to the employments in the
public administration.

The EU case law has been clearly stating, since its first judgments, that
such exception must be interpreted with a really narrow approach and that
it covers only those employment relationships which imply a (direct or
indirect) participation to the exercise of public powers and those functions
which aim at safeguarding general interests of the State or of public entities
(Commission v. Belgium, case 149/79).

Even more, also with respect to the employment relationships falling
within the above categories, the ECJ stated that the application of restrictions
to the free movement of employees must be assessed on a case-by-case basis
(and not in relation to whole employment categories) (see Commission v.

85
F. PALMIERI

Luxembourg, case C-473/93). Such assessment is required as it is necessary to
actually verify if the single case entails the significance of the special duty of
solidarity and loyalty which ties the citizens to their own State (see Commission
v. Belgium, case 149/79).

It follows that formal criteria as such, as the public or private regime of
the employment relationship or the professional title related to the single
employment, have no relevance in such matter.

As a consequence, the restriction at stake has been interpreted in
a really restrictive manner (see, amongst others, Al/ué v. University of
Venice, case 33/88; Kraneman, case C-109/04). For instance, the EC]
excluded that such restriction to the free movement could be applied to
the researchers of the Italian National Centre of Research (Commission v.
Italy, case 225/85), to the employees of public entities which handled the
supply of water, gas and electricity (Commission v. Belgium, case 149/79),
to public schools’ teachers (Bleis, case C-4/91; Commission v. Italy, case
C-371/04) as well as to specialist doctors (Schoenig-Kougebetopoulou, case
C-15/96).

Secondly, Article 45(3) TFEU states that the freedom of movement of
employees may be limited (or even denied) based on grounds of public
order, public safety or public health (see also Articles 27 and following of
Directive 2004/38/EC). Such exceptions are common to all the four key
freedoms of the EU internal market.

Also in this respect the EU case law adopted a very strict approach
in the interpretation and implementation of the above exceptions, also
to avoid that each single Member State could autonomously determine
the scope of same restrictions (see Yiadom, case C-357/98). In such
perspective, it has been clarified that the restriction for public order or public
safety grounds cannot have an economic scope and, more in general, must
be based on requirements of public order or safety as typically recognised
within a democratic society. For instance, the restriction at stake cannot be
relied upon if the scope of the relevant measure is to limit or prevent trade
unions rights.

Furthermore, the Directive 2004/38/EC clarifies that any measure
impairing the freedom of movement for public order or safety reasons
must be necessarily founded on a personal and specific behavior of the
relevant person (Article 27(2)). EU case law specified here that a measure
of expulsion of a different Member State citizen, based on public order
grounds, may be justified only by serious and actual threats to the public
order and the public safety concerning the relevant individual; hence, the

86
FREE MOVEMENT OF PERSONS

Member States adopting a measure of expulsion of a EU citizen must take
into consideration (in addition to the fundamental principle of the freedom
of movement of persons) also the impairment of such measure on other
fundamental rights and, in particular, on the right to the significance of the
family life as set forth by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human
Rights (see Commission v. Germany, case C-441/02).

It is also worth noting that the public order or public safety grounds which
justify the adoption of the relevant restrictive measure must be immediately
communicated to the affected employee, as to allow the latter to adequately
challenge same measure (Lecastaing, case 98/79). The proceedings for the
safeguard of the rights of the employee in such cases are those provided for
by the national law, being understood that they cannot be less favorable than
those applicable to the national employees.

Finally, it must be noted that, in any case, all the above restrictions,
related to the employments in the public administration or to public order,
public safety and public health grounds, being restrictions to a fundamental
EU freedom, must always comply with the general limitations posed to all
the restrictions to key european freedoms and, therefore, must comply with
the principle of proportionality, be adequate to pursue the relevant scope
and not exceed the measures which are necessary to safeguard the interest
to be protected in the actual case (see Kraneman, case C-109/04; Kébler vs.
Republic Osterreich, case C-224/01).

3. The Freedom of Movement of the Citizens

As anticipated, the “leading” rule governing the right of free movement
of the EU citizens lies in Article 21 TFEU, which reads as follows:

1. Every citizen of the Union shall have the right to move
and reside freely within the territory of the Member States,
subject to the limitations and conditions laid down in the
Treaties and by the measures adopted to give them effect.

Such Article sanctions, then, the right of all the citizens of the Member
States to freely move and reside within the entire territory of the Union,
without any reference, any more, to the economic “value” of the activity
carried out (Grzelcezyk, case C-184/99) and, therefore, also regardless of

87
F. PALMIERI

any activity performed by the person (citizen) in a different Member State.

Article 21 TFEU was introduced by the Maastricht Treaty and may be
considered as one of the most significant “ramifications” of the European
Citizenship. In such perspective, the right of free movement and residence
of persons has its foundation in the EU Citizenship and not in the exercise
of an economic activity and it turns to be an instrument for the integration
of the European society itself and not merely of the European Market.

Indeed, said Article is inserted in Part II of the TFEU (titled “NonDiscrimination and Citizenship of the Union”) and must be read jointly
with Article 20(2) TFEU, which states that:

2. Citizens of the Union shall enjoy the rights and be subject
to the duties provided for in the Treaties. They shall have,
inter alia:

(a) the right to move and reside freely within the territory of
the Member States.

as well as jointly with Article 3(2) TEU, which reads as follows:

2. The Union shall offer its citizens an area of freedom,
security and justice without internal frontiers, in which the
free movement of persons is ensured [...].

The ECJ clarified that Article 21 TFEU is a rule having direct effects
and grants rights which may be claimed by the European citizens vis-a-vis
the hosting Member State where they have no right to reside for any other
title (see Baumbast, case C-413/99) and also vis-a-vis their own Member
State (D’Hoop, case C-224/98).

Article 21 TFEU has been recognised on several occasions by the EC]
as one of the most significant rules of the Treaties and the scope of said
Article has been extended as to cover several “border-line” cases. In one of
the leading cases of the matter at stake, the ECJ recognized to a mother
(citizen of a non-EU State), who was in charge of the custody of her
child (EU citizen), the right to reside with the latter in a Member State,
notwithstanding such case was not expressly covered by the EU laws and
regulations (Zhu and Chen, case C-200/02; see also Metock and others,
case C-127/08, Rhimon Chakroun, case C-578/08 and also Zambrano,

88
FREE MOVEMENT OF PERSONS

case C-34/09). Such decision was essentially based on the ground that the
refusal to grant the work permit to the mother in charge of the custody of
her child, who was underage, would have deprived the right of residence
of the latter of any effect whatsoever.

However, it is also worth noting that the European case law clarified
that the right of movement and residence granted by Article 21 TFEU is
not an absolute right, but that the exercise of such right is conditioned
upon the limitations and the conditions provided for by the Treaties and
the relevant EU legislation (as also set forth by same Article 21).

In any case, such limitations and conditions, which the Member States are
entitled to pose for the exercise of the right of movement and residence of the
EU citizens (such as, typically, the availability of enough economical sources
and of a illness insurance, for the person and his/her relatives), must comply
with the principle of proportionality (Grunkin e& others, case C-353/06, and
Rottmann, case C-135/08). Therefore, the conditions posed by the national
regulations to safeguard the legitimate interests of the Member States
(generally, to avoid to suffer from a disproportionate burden for the public
finance) cannot exceed the limits of those measures which are necessary for
the fulfillment of the relevant legitimate scope. In such perspective, it has
been deemed that the lack of an insurance to cover the first aid expenses
given in the hosting Member State was not sufficient to justify a measure
of denial of the exercise of the right of residence (Baumbast, case C-413/99;
but see also De Cuyper, case C-406/04).

The fundamental principle set forth by Article 21 TFEU has been finally
implemented by the Directive 2004/38/EC, which is essentially a consolidated act which combines the complex statutory framework previously in force
in the matter at stake and governs, as of today, the right of the EU citizens and
of their relatives to freely move and reside within the territory of the Union.

3.1. The Right of Entry

The freedom of movement of the EU citizens, as set forth by Article
21 TFEU and by the Directive 2004/38/EC, translates into the right
(essentially “unlimited”) of entry in the territory of all the other Member
States as well as into the right of residence (at certain conditions) in such States
and may also bring to the granting of the right of permanent residence in a
Member State other than the home State.

The right of entry is granted to all the EU citizens and also to their relatives,
regardless of their citizenship (for the notion of relatives see § 3.2 below).

89
F. PALMIERI

The exercise of the right of entry of the EU citizens in a Member State
other than the home Member State may be subject solely to the possession
of a valid identity card or passport, regardless of the grounds leading the
citizens to move within the EU territory (Article 5, Directive 2004/38/EC).

Further requirements, conditions or limits are not allowed. In particular,
controls at the borders which turn to be a regular practice or the requirement
of a (exit or entry) travel visas or even the mere application of a stamp on the
identity card or on the passport are banned (Article 5(1), Directive 2004/38/
EC). The same applies to the request of information, for instance, of the
reasons of the entry, which is allowed only to the extent that the relevant
answer does not result into a condition for the entry into the hosting Member
State (Commission v. the Netherlands, case C-68/89). On the other hand, as to
the non-EU relatives of the EU citizen, their entry may be subject to a visa,
pursuant to Regulation (EC) 539/2001, even if it must be noted that the
authorities of the Member States must grant such visas through a quickest
procedure which does not pose any financial burden upon the applicant.

As a further remark, the hosting Member State may require that the
citizens of a different Member State declare their presence in the national
territory within a reasonable and not discriminatory term, being understood
that the breach of such obligation may trigger only proportionate sanctions.
In this respect, the ECJ stated that a national law which provides for a
criminal sanction if the declaration of stay is not effected within 3 days from
the entry of the EU citizen is in clear violation of the TFEU principles (Z.
Messner [1989], case C-265/88).

3.2. The Right of Residence

As to the right of residence of the EU citizens, three different cases
may occur.

Firstly, the right of entry in a different Member State triggers the right
to “freely” reside in such State up to three months (Article 6, Directive
2004/38/EC).

In this respect, it is worth noting that the right of residence entails
the right to the full equality of treatment as compared to the citizens of
the hosting Member State, with significant ramifications such as the right
to aid in case of birth of a child pursuant to the same conditions of the
“national” citizens (not being allowed in this case the application of any
further requirement, e.g. the elapse of a given period of residence within
the relevant Member State) (Commission v. Luxembourg, case C-111/91).

90
FREE MOVEMENT OF PERSONS

Secondly, all the EU citizens (and, therefore, not only the employees
or the individuals exercising the right of establishment or the right to the
free provision of services) have the right to reside in a different Member
State also after the elapse of the above mentioned 3-month period.

However, such residence right is subject to the occurrence of the conditions
set forth in Article 7(1) of Directive 2004/38/EC; in particular, it is required that
the relevant EU citizens:

a) have sufficient resources for themselves and their relatives and
have an adequate illness insurance coverage in such State (as not
to become a burden for the social security system of the hosting
Member State during the residence period); or

b) are registered at a (private or public) institute of the hosting Member
State to attend a study course, have an adequate illness insurance
coverage in such State and guarantee to have sufficient resources (for
them and their family members) not to be a burden for such State.

As a noteworthy remark, the right of residence is granted also to the
relatives of the EU citizens who exercise such right, regardless of their
citizenship.

The notion of relatives, provided for by Article 2(2) of the Directive
2004/38/EC, includes:

a) the spouse;

b) the partner who contracted with a EU citizen a registered
partnership pursuant to the legislation of a Member State, in such
cases where the legislation of the hosting Member State equalizes
the registered partnerships to the marriage and in compliance
with the conditions provided for by the relevant legislation of the
hosting Member State;

c) the direct descendants who are under the age of 21 or are dependent
on the EU citizen as well as those of the spouse or partner as defined
under letter (b) above; and

d) the direct relatives in the ascending line who are dependent on
the EU citizen as well as those of the spouse or partner as defined
under letter (b) above.

Moreover, Article 3(2) of the Directive 2004/38/EC states that the
hosting Member States, consistently with their national legislation, must
facilitate the entry and residence of (i) any other relative of the EU citizen

91
F. PALMIERI

(regardless of their citizenship) if such relative is dependent on or lives, in
the home State, with the EU citizen or if; due to serious health reasons,
the EU citizen must assist such relative personally, and (it) the partner with
whom the EU citizen has a permanent relationship, duly certified. The
Article at stake essentially translates into a mere “invitation” to the Member
States to approve national laws and regulations extending the reunification
rights also the above persons, even if same Article 3(2) specifies that the
hosting Member State must perform an in-depth analysis of the relevant
personal situations above indicated and must justify the denial (if any) to
the entry or residence of the above persons.

In general terms, the EU legislator appears to be fully aware that the actual
implementation of the principle of free movement of citizens necessarily
depends also on the preservation of the family ties and that the cohabitation
in case of exercise of the freedom of movement is a crucial value. In such
perspective, the family reunification also supports the integration of the
citizens of other Member States in the hosting State and contributes to the
achievement of the economical and social cohesion which is one of the key
objectives of the EU Treaties.

Articles 2 and 35 of such Directive allow, in any case, the Member States
to implement also all the measures necessary to deny or revoke the granting
of the relatives’ movement and residence right in case of abuse or fraud, such
as it may typically occur in case of fictitious marriages.

It is also worth noting that the Directive 2004/38/EC repealed the
requirement of the “residence card” for the EU citizens and allowed the
hosting Member States to require, only in case of the exercise of a right of
residence exceeding the 3-month period, the registration with the competent
authorities, with the obligation of the latter to immediately release the relevant
certificate. Moreover, the conditions which the Member States may pose
for granting such certificate are strictly governed by Article 8 of the above
mentioned Directive, to avoid that the release of the relevant document results
into a limitation to the citizen's right of free movement.

Thirdly, pursuant to Article 16 and following of Directive 2004/38/EC,
the EU citizens as well as their relatives, who have been residing legally on a
continuous basis for at least five years in a different Member State, acquire
the right of so-called “permanent residence” in such State. Such right is not
subject to any condition, even if it must be noted that, once acquired, the
right of permanent residence is extinguished in case of absence from the
hosting Member State for a period exceeding 2 consecutive years.

As a final note, the only restrictions allowed to the exercise of the freedom

92
FREE MOVEMENT OF PERSONS

of movement of the EU citizens and of their relatives are those based on public
order, public safety or public health grounds, being understood that such
restrictions must be proportionate and based on the personal behavior of the
relevant person. The above grounds cannot be invoked to justify a restrictive
measure based on economic reasons (see Article 27 and following, Directive
2004/38/EC).

To assess whether the concerned individual is a danger for the public
order or safety, the hosting Member State is entitled (if this is necessary) to
request to the home Member State and the other Member States where the
person has been residing information on his/her criminal records. However,
such request of information cannot turn to be systematic as to constitute an
illegal impairment on the rights granted by the EU legislation.

With specific reference to the public order or safety restriction, as
anticipated (see § 2.5 above), the EC] on several occasions clarified that
same restriction must be interpreted with a narrow approach as it impairs
the exercise of a EU fundamental freedom, which may not be limited in
general terms but only based on clear and specific conditions.

As to the proportionality requirement, it is worth mentioning that the
existence of criminal convictions cannot justify, per se, the adoption of leaving
measures, unless such convictions certify that the presence of the EU citizen
(or of his/her relatives) in the territory of the hosting Member State is a an
actual threat to the social safety of such State. Moreover, a measure of leave
from the national territory cannot be ordered as autonomous sanction or
provision ancillary to a criminal sanction if the above conditions are not met.

As a consequence, all the restrictions to the freedom of movement
must be founded on the personal behavior of the concerned person, which
must represent an effective, actual and serious risk susceptible to impair a
fundamental interest of the hosting Member State. Hence, grounds having
a general scope, with punitive or preventive purposes, cannot be adduced
to justify any measure restrictive of the freedom of movement and residence
(see Orfanopoulos and others, case C-482/01; Oliveri, case C-493/01; see also
Bonsignore vs. Oberstadtdirektor der Stadt Koln, case 67174).

As a further “limitation” to the scope of the above restrictions, prior to
the adoption of any measure of expulsion for public order or safety reasons,
the hosting Member State must take into account a number of additional
mandatory “assessment criteria’, which are given by the duration of the
residence of the concerned person in its territory, his/her age, the health
conditions, the family situation and the level of integration reached within
the territory as well as his/her connections with the home Member State. In

93
F. PALMIERI

particular, the hosting Member State is entitled to implement measures of
leave of persons who acquired the permanent residence right only for serious
reasons of public order or safety, while, on the other hand, solely imperative reasons of public safety may justify the leave order to persons who have
been residing in the hosting Member State for at least 10 years or who are
underage (Article 28, Directive 2004/38/EC).

Finally, as to the public health grounds which legitimate the adoption
of restrictive measures, it is worth noting that the Directive 2004/38/EC
sets forth the various diseases which may justify the deny of entry, but also
specifies that the occurrence of a sickness after the elapse of three months
from the date of entry of the EU citizen does not allow the hosting Member
State to order the leave of the citizen (see Article 29).

3.3. The Schengen Treaty

As of today, the freedom of movement and residence within the EU territory is a right recognised to all the EU citizens and their relatives.

However, as mentioned, such right does not entail the abolition of
the borders’ controls as the same statutory framework set forth by the EU
provides for the obligation to show a valid identity card or passport for the
exercise of the right of entry into a different Member State. All the past
legislative proposals to proceed to the repealing of such controls found the
strong resistance of certain Member States.

Therefore, an increasing number of Member States decided to enter into
separate treaties in this respect and, in particular, to execute the so-called
Schengen Treaty.

The Schengen Treaty has been executed firstly on 1985 and then
subsequently amended (in particular, following the various deeds of adherence
of several States). Currently, it applies to 26 States and, more in detail, to 22
EU Member States (with the exclusion of United Kingdom, Ireland, Romania,
Bulgaria, Cyprus and Croatia) and 4 non-EU States (namely, Island, Norway,
Switzerland and Liechtenstein). With the Amsterdam Treaty, the Schengen
‘Treaty and the relevant agreements and, therefore, the whole Schengen acquis
have been finally “incorporated” in the EU legal and institutional framework.

The key principle set forth by such Treaty lies in the absence of the
obligation, for the individuals of the relevant participant States, to show
any document when crossing the internal EU borders and, therefore, in
the freedom for the citizens to cross the borders without any control (save
for those justified by public order and safety grounds).

94
FREE MOVEMENT OF PERSONS

Such Treaty also entails a significant cooperation between the police
officers of all the adhering States, in particular to fight criminal phenomena
and irregular immigration cases.

It is also worth mentioning that, due to the recent migrant crisis and the
terroristic attacks in the European territory, the Schengen Treaty has been
recently partially suspended by certain adhering States (see, in particular,
Commissions Communication “Back to Schengen - A Roadmap” COM
(2016) 120 final).

In any case, most significantly, with particular reference to the EU
Member States, the Schengen Treaty aims at achieving the ultimate scope
of having the territory of all the relevant Member States fully “combined”
as one sole territory and, therefore, at ensuring the fullest implementation
of the freedom of movement of the Citizens within the EU territory.

1. Free movement of services
1.1. Legislative provisions and historical evolution

The idea of an action programme aimed at removing barriers to the
freedom to provide services had already been envisaged by the founders in
the original Articles 59-66 of the Treaty of Rome (Treaty establishing the
European Economic Community), where it was provided for that such
restrictions were to be “progressively abolished”.

Indeed, given the specific nature of self-employment and given the
presence of different national laws regulating the exercise of such activities,

105
A. PAOLETTI

the European legislator considered it appropriate to provide for an
autonomous and specific set of regulations from the outset with respect to
the one foreseen for the movement of persons.

Currently, rules governing the free movement of services are included
in Part HI (Union policies and internal actions’), Title IV (“Free movement
of persons, services and capital’), Chapter 3 (‘Services’), Articles 56 to 62 of
the TFEU. In particular, Art. 56, paragraph 1, TFEU, provides for freedom

to provide services within the European Union.

Article 56 TFEU
1. Within the framework of the provisions set out below,
restrictions on freedom to provide services within the Union
shall be prohibited in respect of nationals of Member States
who are established in a Member State other than that of the
person for whom the services are intended.

[aan

Subsequent articles explain what a service is (Art. 57, TFEU), address
aspects of certain specific services (Art. 58, TFEU) and aspects relating to
the process of liberalisation and harmonisation (Articles 59 to 61, TFEU).
Finally, Art. 62 extends the applicability of provisions of Articles 51 to 54,
TFEU, regarding freedom of establishment, to matters covered by freedom
to provide services. The application of such rules will be subject to a specific
analysis in paragraph 2.

The above-mentioned Articles 56 to 62, TFEU, merely reproduce earlier
regulations set forth in Articles 49 to 55 of the European Community Treaty
(as amended by the Maastricht Treaty).

Indeed, except for the substitution of the consultation procedure
by the ordinary legislative procedure (see, for example, Art. 59, para. 1,
TFEU), the Lisbon Treaty has only made merely formal changes such as
the introduction of the term ‘Union’ instead of ‘Community’ (Art. 49,
para. 1, TFEU) or the reference to “Treaties’ instead of “Treaty’ (Art. 57,
para. 1, TFEU). Direct application of Art. 56 et seg. TFEU is completed by
Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of
12 December 2006 on services in the internal market.

Moreover, there is much case law to consider and this will be analysed

in the following paragraphs.

106
FREEDOM TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND FREEDOM OF ESTABLISHMENT

1.2. What are services?

Within the meaning of the Treaties, ‘service’ can be briefly defined as
(i) any self-employed economic activity, (ii) having a temporary nature
and (777) normally provided for remuneration.

In the light of the above, the following paragraphs will separately
analyse the elements making up definition of a service, identified in the
self-employed, temporary and remunerated character of its performance.

1.2.1. Self-employed economic activity

The service must have been provided by a self-employed person, outside
of an employment relationship, under his sole responsibility, and therefore not
under the direction of an employer (C:PM. Meeusen, case C-337/97, para. 15;
Aldona Malgorzata Jany and others, case C-268/99, paras. 34, 70, 71).

Moreover, Article 57, para. 2, TFEU, specifies which provisions fall
within the regulations of freedom to provide services, expressly mentioning:
(t) activities of an industrial character; (zz) activities of a commercial character; (iii) activities of craftsmen; (iv) activities of the professions.

Article 57
[...]

‘Services’ shall in particular include: (a) activities of an
industrial character; (0) activities of a commercial character;
(c) activities of craftsmen; (d) activities of the professions.

[...]

The above-mentioned list, as highlighted by unanimous case law and
doctrine, is merely illustrative: indeed, free movement of services applies, in
principle, to the generality of economic activities.

Finally, it must be underlined that the rules concerning transport,
governed by Articles 90-100, TFEU, as well as banking and insurance services
connected with movements of capital, whose regulation shall be effected in
step with the liberalisation of movement of capital, do not fall within the
application of Articles 56-62, TFEU.

Article 58

1. Freedom to provide services in the field of transport shall be

107
A. PAOLETTI

governed by the provisions of the Title relating to transport.

2. The liberalisation of banking and insurance services
connected with movements of capital shall be effected in step
with the liberalisation of movement of capital.

1.2.2. Temporary nature

In order to fall within the provisions on freedom to provide services,
the service must have a temporary nature.

The above-mentioned requirement is based on Art. 57, paragraph
3, TFEU, according to which, in the event involving movement by the
service provider from one Member State to another Member State, the
person who provides the service may ‘temporarily pursue such activity in
the State where the service is provided.

Article 57
[...]

3. Without prejudice to the provisions of the Chapter relating
to the right of establishment, the person providing a service
may, in order to do so, temporarily pursue his activity in the
Member State where the service is provided, under the same
conditions as are imposed by that State on its own nationals.

The temporary nature is the discriminating threshold between freedom
of establishment and freedom to provide services. Indeed, while the concept
of freedom to provide services presupposes a temporary nature, freedom of
establishment requires a lasting presence in another Member State.

The European Court of Justice has pointed out that the temporary
nature of the provision of services has to be determined with reference
to its regularity, periodicity, duration and continuity from an economic
point of view (Reinhard Gebhard, case C-55/94, paras. 27 - 39).

However, there is not any provision of the Treaty establishing the
duration or frequency beyond which one might speak of freedom to
provide service or freedom of establisment. Consequently, the freedom to
provide services can encompass economic activities of different natures,
including services which are provided for an extended period of time, even
years (Joint cases Duomo Gpa Srl, case C-357/10, Gestione Servizi Pubblici
Srl, case C-358/10 and Irtel Srl, case C-359/10, para. 32; Bruno Schnitzer,
case C-215/01, paras. 30 and 31).

108
FREEDOM TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND FREEDOM OF ESTABLISHMENT

1.2.3 Self-employed economic activity normally provided for remuneration

As we have mentioned above, according to Article 57, paragraph 1,
TFEU, services “are normally provided for remuneration’. The essential
characteristic of remuneration consists in the fact that it constitutes
consideration for the service in question (Herbert Schwarz, case C-76/05,
para. 38; Belgian State, case C-263/86, para. 17; B.S.M. Geraets-Smits, case
C-157/99, para. 58; Rolf Dieter Danner, case C-136/00, para. 26; Freskot
AE, case C-355/00, para. 55; Forsikringsaktiebolaget Skandia (publ.) and
Ola Ramstedt, case C-422/01, para. 23).

Article 57
1. Services shall be considered to be ‘services’ within the
meaning of the Treaties where they are normally provided
for remuneration, in so far as they are not governed by the
provisions relating to freedom of movement for goods,
capital and persons.

[...]

On this point, the European Court of Justice has specified that the
consideration must be paid either directly by the beneficiary of the service
or indirectly by a third party, regardless of the relationship between the
recipient of the service and the payer. For instance, medical services were
considered as falling within the freedom to provide services even if services
are not paid directly by the patient but indirectly by the National Health
Service (The Queen, on the application of Yvonne Watts, case C-372/04,
para. 86; Georgi Ivanov Elchinov, Case C-173/09, para. 36).

On the contrary, services for which there is no provision of any
consideration or other financial consideration do not fall within the definition.

In the light of the above, the European Court of Justice stated that
courses taught in an institute which form part of the national education
system cannot be regarded as services. Indeed, in such cases, the State is not
seeking to engage in gainful activity, but is fulfilling its duties towards its
own population in the social, cultural and educational fields, through the
public budget. Moreover, the European Court of Justice has specified that
even small payments that a State requires students to pay cannot be held
to be a consideration if they are essentially symbolic fees in order to merely
contribute to the operating expenses of the system (Stephan Max Wirth, case
C-109/92, para. 15; Belgium State, case C-263/86, 1998, paras. 18 and 19).

On the other hand, education given by a private school establishment

109
A. PAOLETTI

constitutes a service since it is essentially financed by private funds and seeks
to make an economic profit (Stephan Max Wirth, case C-109/92, para. 15).

However such an approach shows some ambiguity: what will be the
applicable law in the event that a course is financed half by public funds
and half from student fees?

Finally, the European Court of Justice has stated that Articles 56 et seq.
apply even if the consideration is paid much further in advance than for
the provision of service, as is the case for occupational pension insurance

(Forsikringsaktiebolaget Skandia (publ.) and Ola Ramstedt, case C-422/01).

1.3. Essence of the freedom to provide services: prohibition of direct and
indirect discrimination on the basis of nationality or residence

The principle characterising the rules is, im primis, that of ‘national
treatment’. In other words, beneficiaries of freedom to provide services are
entitled to receive the same treatment that the host State reserves for its
citizens, without facing direct or indirect discrimination based on nationality.

In addition to discrimination based on nationality, European legislation
also prohibits discrimination based on residence. Indeed, because the provider
carries out only a temporary provision in the host State, in some cases, the
application of national treatment may not be an appropriate measure in order
to realise the free movement of services.

Art. 61
1. As long as restrictions on freedom to provide services have
not been abolished, each Member State shall apply such
restrictions without distinction on grounds of nationality
or residence to all persons providing services within the

meaning of the first paragraph of Article 56.

Moreover, the European Court of Justice has also clarified that Article
56, TFEU, requires not only the elimination of all discrimination on the
basis of nationality against providers of services who are established in
another Member State, but also the abolition of any national rules which
have the effect of making the provision of services between Member States
more difficult than the provision of services purely within one Member
State (Joint cases Federico Cipolla, case C- 94/04, and Stefano Macrino,
case C-202/04, paras. 56 and 57; Manfred Sager, case C- 76/90, para. 12).

110
FREEDOM TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND FREEDOM OF ESTABLISHMENT

In the light of the above, the European Court of Justice has stated that
the Italian provision requiring that undertakings established in Italy have to
maintain their registered office or a branch office on Italian territory, and to
lodge a guarantee with a credit institution having its registered office or a
branch office on Italian territory, is contrary to the freedom to provide services
(Commission of the European Communities, case C-279/00, paras. 34 and 41).

It should be noted that rules of a Member State do not constitute a
restriction within the meaning of Article 56 et seg., TFEU, solely by virtue
of the fact that other Member States apply less strict, or more commercially
favourable, rules to providers of similar services established in their territory
(European Commission, case C-565/08, para. 49; Commission of the European
Communities, case C-439/99, para. 63).

Furthermore, mere domestic situations which have no connection with
more than one Member State are also excluded from the operation of this
provision. Indeed, purely domestic situations whose elements are confined
within a single Member State or which have no connection with the European
legal system are excluded from the operational scope of that provision (Joined
case Airport Shuttle Express scarl and Giovanni Panarisi, case C-162/12,
and Societa Cooperativa Autonoleggio Piccola arl and Gianpaolo Vivani, case
C-163/12, para 43; Unita Socio-Sanitaria Locale n. 47 di Biella (USSL), case
C-134/95, para. 19).

The provisions on freedom to provide services, in fact, apply only to
situations which have a link with intra-Community trade. Whether that
is the case depends on findings of fact which are for the national court to
ascertain (Procureur du Roi, case C-52/79, para. 9).

Moreover, while reiterating that the rules on freedom to provide services
do not apply to purely domestic issues, the European Court of Justice has
repeatedly ruled on this point, considering that such a ruling would however
be useful in the case in which national law imposed recognition of the same
rights for a national citizen as those from which, in the same situation, the
citizen of another member State would benefit on the basis of EU law VJJoined
case Airport Shuttle Express scarl and Giovanni Panarisi, case C-162/12,
and Societa Cooperativa Autonoleggio Piccola arl and Gianpaolo Vivani, case
C-163/12).

Cases of reverse discrimination may well occur in those cases where crossborder economic operators who have benefited from freedom of movement
are accorded more favourable legal treatment, under European law, than that
accorded to national service providers.

The provisions of Articles 56 to 62, TFEU, apply both to individuals

111
A. PAOLETTI

and to legal persons.

In particular, referring to individuals, applicability of the above-mentioned
provisions is subject to the possession of the citizenship of a Member State,
as stated in Art. 56, para. 1, TFEU, which forbids restrictions in respect of
nationals of Member States.

The applicability of freedom of service to legal persons results from the
combined provisions of Articles 54 (relating to the establishment of companies)
and 62, TFEU. In particular, in order to be treated in the same way as
individuals, legal persons have (z) to be formed in accordance with the law of
a Member State and (7) have their registered office, central administration or
principal place of business within the European Union.

It should be noted that the TFEU does not extend the benefit of freedom
of service to providers who are citizens of non-member Countries, even if
they are established within the European Union, and the provision refers to
an intra-EU service (FKP Scorpio Konzertproduktionen GmbH, case C-290/04,
para. 68). However, according to Art. 56, para. 3, TFEU, the European
Parliament and the Council may extend the provisions of freedom of service
to nationals of a third Country who provides services and who are established
within the European Union.

Article 56
[...]
2. The European Parliament and the Council, acting in
accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, may
extend the provisions of the Chapter to nationals of a third
country who provide services and who are established within
the Union.

In any case, despite the proposed directives on this point, the provision
referred to in Art. 56, para. 2, TFEU, has not been implemented in practice so far.

There are four ways in which free movement of services finds concrete
application: (z) through movement of the provider; (zi) through movement
of the beneficiary; (zi) through movement either of the provider or the
beneficiary into a third Member State; (zv) through movement of the service
itself, without any movement of the provider and the beneficiary.

112
FREEDOM TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND FREEDOM OF ESTABLISHMENT

1.3.1. Movement of the provider

The TFEU expressly specifies the case where the service provider
moves from the State of establishment to the beneficiary's Member State
in order to temporarily carry out an economic activity. Indeed, by virtue
of Art. 57, para. 2, TFEU: “the person providing a service may (...) pursue
his activity in the Member State where the service is provided”.

This principle was put in place by the European Court of Justice,
according to which Art. 56, TFEU, requires the abolition of any limitation
on the freedom to provide services based on the ground that the person
providing a service is established in a Member State other than the one in
which the service is provided (FKP Scorpio Konzertproduktionen GmbH, case
C-290/04; FidiumFinanz AG, case C-452/04, para. 31).

1.3.2. Movement of the beneficiary

Case law of the European Court of Justice has clarified that freedom to
provide services shall also apply when the beneficiary of the service moves to the
providers Member State in order to receive the service on the same conditions
as which the service is offered to the citizens of that Member State (Joint cases
Graziana Luisi, case C-286/82, and Giuseppe Carbone, case C-26/83; lan
William Cowan, case C-186/87; European Commission, case C-211-08; Société
dinvestissement pour lagriculture tropicale SA (SIAT), case C-318/10).

The leading case law for this approach comes from joint cases of the
European Court of Justice No. 286/82 and No. 26/83 where two Italian
citizens (Graziana Luisi and Giuseppe Carbone) were fined for having
used means of payment abroad, for the purposes of tourism and medical
treatment, at an exchange value greater than the maximum permitted limit
under Italian law. In particular, in case No. 26/83, the plaintiff in the main
proceedings affirmed that the foreign currency purchased by him had
been used for a stay of certain months in the Federal Republic of Germany
as a tourist. In Case No. 286/82, the plaintiff stated that she had exported
the currency in question for the purpose of various visits to France and the
Federal Republic of Germany as a tourist and in order to receive medical
treatment in the latter Member State.

Both plaintiffs stated that the restrictions on the export of means of
payment in foreign currency for the purpose of medical treatment or tourism
were contrary to the provisions of the EEC Treaty.

As touched upon, the European Court of Justice stated that while the
TFEU expressly mentioned only the case where the person providing the
service moves to the Member State where the person for whom it is provided

113
A. PAOLETTI

is established, the opposite case (where it is the person for whom the service
is provided who moves to the State in which the person providing the service
is established) is the necessary corollary thereof, which fulfils the objective of
liberalising all gainful activity not covered by the free movement of goods,
persons and capital (para. 10).

It follows that freedom to provide services includes the freedom for
the beneficiaries of services to move to another Member State for receive
a service there, without being limited by restrictions, even in relation to
payments; in the light of the above, persons receiving medical treatment,
tourists and persons travelling for the purpose of business or education are
to be considered as recipients of services (para. 16).

1.3.3. Movement of the provider and the beneficiary in a third Member State

Another form of mobility concerns the case in which both parties, the
provider and the recipient of the service (from different Member States or
both established on the same) are moving simultaneously towards a third
Member State where the service will be performed (Commission of the
European Communities, case C-180/89; ITC Innovative Technology Center
GmbH, case C-208/05).

Here we will analyse one of the most important cases on this specific matter:
European Court of Justice case law of 28 October 1999, Skatteministeriet v.
Bent Vestergaard (case C-55/98).

This case law refers to a Danish citizen, Bent Vestergaard, who had
attended a tax training course on the island of Crete. This course was
organised solely by a firm of Danish auditors in conjunction with a travel
agency. Out of the seven days spent in Greece, only three whole days and
two half days were dedicated to the course. Moreover, costs related to
participation in the course, travel and accommodation were paid by the
company of which Vestergaard was a partner.

The Danish National Tax Tribunal (‘Landsskatteret’) stated that the expenses
referring to Vestergaard’s participation in the course in Crete could not therefore
be deducted from his taxable income according to the Danish law.

Vestergaard appealed against this decision before the competent court,
claiming, zvter alia, the incomptibility of the Danish law with the provisions on
freedom to provide services within the European Union.

It is important to point out that in order for services such as the organisation
of professional training courses, to fall within the provision on freedom of
service, it is sufficient for them to be provided to citizens of a Member State on
the territory of another Member State, regardless of the place of establishment

114
FREEDOM TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND FREEDOM OF ESTABLISHMENT

of the provider or recipient of the services.

Indeed, the European Court of Justice underlined that freedom on service
applies not only where a person providing a service and the beneficiary are
established in different Member States, but also when a provider of services
offers those services in a Member State other than the one in which he is

established (para. 19).

1.3.4. By way of circulation of the service itself, without any movement of

the provider and the beneficiary

Finally, the European Court of Justice has brought within the scope of
Article 57 TFEU also the circumstances in which only the service circulates, without any physical movement of the supplier and the recipient (Her
Mayjestys Customs and Excise, case C-275/92, para. 37; Stichting Collectieve
Antennevoorziening Gouda and others, case C-288/89). We refer, for instance,
to services provided over the internet, telecommunications or television.

In this regard, an important leading case is the case law Piergiorgio
Gambelli and Others (case C-243/01), relating to the gambling sector.

In particular, the Italian Court of Ascoli Piceno asked the European Court
of Justice for a preliminary ruling on the compatibility of the provision on
the freedom to provide services with the Italian domestic legislation which
prohibits the pursuit by any person anywhere of the activities of collecting,
taking, booking and forwarding offers of bets, in particular bets on sporting
events, unless the requirements concerning concessions and authorisations
prescribed by domestic law have been complied with (para. 24).

The above-mentioned question was raised in a criminal case brought
against Mr Gambelli and other people who were accused of having unlawfully
organised clandestine bets and of being the proprietors of centres carrying on
the activity of collecting and transmitting betting data, which constitutes an
offence of fraud according to Italian law.

On this respect, the European Court of Justice stated that where a provider established in a Member State offers a service via the internet — and thus
does so without moving — this falls within the provisions of the freedom to
provide services. Consequently, any restriction of those activities constitutes
a restriction on the freedom of such a provider to provide services (para. 54).

1.4. The residual character of the freedom to provide services

According to Art. 57, par. I, second part, TFEU, the definition of ‘service’

plays a residual role in relation to the other fundamental economic freedoms

115
A. PAOLETTI

of movement. In other words, the chapter on the free movement of services
will apply only when the rules on the free movement of persons, goods and
capital cannot apply.

Article 57

1. Services shall be considered to be ‘services’ within the
meaning of the Treaties where they are normally provided
for remuneration, in so far as they are not governed by the
provisions relating to freedom of movement for goods,
capital and persons.

[...]

That is not all. The free movement of services also has a residual
nature with respect to the rules on freedom of establishment. In other
words, only in the event that the specific case cannot fall within the scope
of freedom of establishment will the provisions on the free movement of
services apply.

Article 57
[...]
1. Without prejudice to the provisions of the Chapter relating
to the right of establishment, the person providing a service
may, in order to do so, temporarily pursue his activity in the
Member State where the service is provided, under the same
conditions as are imposed by that State on its own nationals.

This principle has also been reaffirmed by the European Court of
Justice which in the Gebhard case held that “the provisions relating to
services apply only if those relating to the right of establishment do not apply”
(case C-55/94, para. 22).

1.5. Exceptions to the exercise of freedom of establishment

The rules on freedom to provide services (as well as that on the freedom
of establishment) come up against legal limits in the case in which (z) the
activity is connected with the exercise of official authority; (i) there are

grounds of public policy, public security or public health.

116
FREEDOM TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND FREEDOM OF ESTABLISHMENT

In addition to the above limits, the law has provided for the possibility
of waiving the rules on freedom to provide services (as well as on the
freedom of establishment) where there are overriding grounds of public
interest, as we shall see in greater detail in the following paragraphs.

1.5.1. Exercise of official authority

Under Art. 51, TFEU, the rules on freedom to provide services do not
apply in cases where the activity exercised is connected, even occasionally,
with the exercise of official authority.

Art. 51
1. The provisions of this Chapter shall not apply, so far as

any given Member State is concerned, to activities which in
that State are connected, even occasionally, with the exercise
of official authority.

This framework, dictated with specific reference to freedom

of establishment, is applicable to the freedom to provide
services by virtue of the reference made by Art. 62, TFEU.

Art. 62

1. The provisions of Articles 51 to 54 shall apply to the
matters covered by this Chapter.

The ratio for this waiver is to allow each State to reserve for its citizens
activities which, consisting in the exercise of official authority, imply a
close fiduciary relationship with the State itself.

The European Court of Justice has stressed that, because it is an exception,
this framework must be interpreted restrictively.

In this regard, the Court has stated that a traineeship performed at a
magistrate’s office does not constitute an exercise of official authority insofar
as it is carried out under the supervision and in accordance with instructions

given by the training principal (Pesla, case C-345/08, para. 30/33).

1.5.2. Grounds of public policy, public security or public health

Under Art. 52, TFEU — applicable, as we have seen, by virtue of the
reference made by Art. 62, TFEU — Member States may adopt measures
restricting the freedom to provide services where such measures are justified on

the grounds of public policy, public security or public health. In other words,

117
A. PAOLETTI

when there are the above grounds, Member States may impose measures that
discriminate on the basis of nationality or residence.

Art. 62
1. The provisions of this Chapter and measures taken in
pursuance thereof shall not prejudice the applicability of
provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative
action providing for special treatment for foreign nationals

on grounds of public policy, public security or public health.

As in the case ex Art. 51, TFEU, such restrictions should be interpreted
restrictively and, in any case, must be proportionate to the objective pursued.

1.5.3. Overriding grounds of public interest: further restrictions introduced

by case law

As we saw in the preceding paragraphs, Member States may adopt
regulations that discriminate on the basis of nationality or residence only in cases
provided for in Articles 51 and 52, TFEU; that is, when the activity involves
the exercise of official authority (Art. 51) or there are grounds of public policy,
public security or public health (Art. 52). While the possibility of introducing
discriminatory measures exists only in those cases, the Court has recognised
the possibility of introducing measures which restrict the freedom to
provide services where these are (z) applicable without distinction to all EU
citizens and (ii) there are grounds of public interest.

The concept of grounds of public interest is quite large and will
include, for example, the protection of workers (Guiot, case C-272/94,
para. 20-22); of consumers (joint cases De Agostini, case C-34/95, case
C-35/95 and case C-36/95, para. 53); and of national historic and artistic
heritage (Commission of the European Communities, case C-180/89).

Furthermore, because a restriction on the freedom to provide services
can be applied in addition to the above conditions ((z) and (zz)), it is also
necessary that (zzz) the restrictions introduced are necessary to achieve the
purpose; (zv) the measure adopted do not go beyond what is necessary
to attain it (principle of proportionality); (v) the interest that is to be
protected does not already have adequate protection in other provisions
(Commission of the European Communities, case C-219/08).

118
FREEDOM TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND FREEDOM OF ESTABLISHMENT

2. Freedom of establishment
2.1. Legislative provisions and historical evolution

The rules on freedom of establishment are contained in Part III (Union
policies and internal actions’), Title [V (“Free movement of persons, services
and capital’), Chapter II (‘Right of establishment’), Articles 49 and 55,
TFEU. As with the freedom to provide services, the Lisbon Treaty has made
no substantial changes to the rules.

Indeed, the amendments concerned the introduction of the term
‘Unior instead of ‘Community’ (Art. 50, para. 2, lett. 6)), the reference to
the ordinary procedure instead of the co-decision (Art. 50, para 1; Art. 51;
Art. 52, para 2), the unification of the paragraphs 1 and 2 of the previous
Article 47 TCE (Art. 53, para. 1, TFEU) and the European Parliament
increased powers (Art. 50, para 2).

In addition, as for the freedom to provide services, the direct application
of Art. 49 et seg., TFEU, is completed by Directive 2006/123/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on services
in the internal market.

Freedom of establishment can tentatively be defined as the right to
move to a Member State other than that of origin in order to pursue in a
stable way an economic activity that is not subject to the same conditions
as provided for its own nationals by the host Member State.

Article 49

1. Within the framework of the provisions set out below,
restrictions on the freedom of establishment of nationals of a
Member State in the territory of another Member State shall
be prohibited. Such prohibition shall also apply to restrictions
on the setting-up of agencies, branches or subsidiaries by
nationals of any Member State established in the territory of
any Member State.

2. Freedom of establishment shall include the right to take
up and pursue activities as self-employed persons and to set
up and manage undertakings, in particular companies or
firms within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article
54, under the conditions laid down for its own nationals by
the law of the country where such establishment is effected,
subject to the provisions of the Chapter relating to capital.

119
A. PAOLETTI

In practical terms, therefore, freedom of establishment can be attained:
i) through the creation or transfer of a place of business or profession

in a Member State other than that of origin (Art. 49, paragraph
2, TFEU); or

ii) through setting up one or more secondary locations (branches,
agencies or subsidiaries) in a Member State other than that of origin
(Art. 49 paragraph 1, TFEU).
In the first case, it is customary to speak of primary establishment,
while in the second case of secondary establishment, insofar as the main
activity continues to be conducted in the State or origin.

2.2. Freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services

As in the case of freedom to provide services, freedom of establishment
regards non-subordinate work activities. Moreover, while the freedom
to provide services applies to activities carried out on an occasional and
temporary basis, freedom of establishment concerns activities carried out
continuously and permanently.

Consider, for example, the case of a doctor, a German national, who
decides to carry out his activities exclusively (or at least mainly) in France.
In this case, we will have a hypothesis of freedom of primary establishment.

In the case in which, however, the same doctor of German origin decides
to carry out his activity in his country of origin and only occasionally
provide services in France, we would fall under the rules on freedom to
provide services.

Moreover, the difference between the freedom of primary establishment
and freedom to provide services is quite clear, the difference between the latter
and the freedom of secondary establishment is less clear, given that it does
not appear easy in practice to distinguish between cases where the provider
relies on a secondary establishment, rather than on a simple infrastructure
which functions merely in the context of the provision of cross-border
services. In fact, in both cases, the main activity is carried out within the
State of origin. In this case, the difference comes from the different intensity
of the link with the ‘host’ State: with a secondary establishment, the selfemployed person will carry out an activity, albeit not the main activity, in
a stable manner, whereas in the case of the freedom to provide services the
worker will exercise the activity only occasionally. In practice, however, this
distinction is not always so clear, given that the European Court of Justice

120
FREEDOM TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND FREEDOM OF ESTABLISHMENT

has held that the existence of an office or study does not rule out the nature
of the freedom to provide services as part of the activity, to the extent that
this structure appears necessary for the performance of the service (Gebhard,

case C-55/94).
2.3. Essence of the freedom of establishment

The rules on freedom of establishment apply to both individuals and
legal persons, and, as for the freedom to provide services, do not apply to
activities whose relevant elements are confined within a single Member
State (Government of the French Community and Walloon Government,
case C-212/06; Criminal proceedings against Jean-Louis Aubertin, Bernard
Collignon, Guy Creusot, Isabelle Diblanc, Gilles Josse, Jacqueline Martin
and Claudie Normand, case C-29/94, case C-30/94, case C-31/94, case
C-32/94, case C-33/94, case C-34/94 and case C-35/94; Ministére public,
case C-20/87, para. 12. See also para. 1.3).

In both cases, as for the freedom to provide services, regulation rotates
around the principle of national treatment. Moreover, considering the
different problems that have arisen from the practice, we will address the
freedom of establishment of individuals and legal persons separately in the

following paragraphs.

2.3.1. Freedom of establishment of individuals

The prerequisite for the application of freedom of establishment of
individuals is possession of the nationality of a European Union State.

As for the freedom to provide services, freedom of establishment
includes the prohibition of discrimination, either direct or indirect, on the
basis of nationality. This implies the obligation for the host Member State
to reserve for natural or legal persons the same treatment as for its own
citizens or for their bodies, with any discrimination based on nationality
being prohibited. On the other hand, the State of origin may not impede
the natural or legal person who decides to settle in another Member State.

In the light of the above, the European Court of Justice has, for example,
established the obligation of national authorities — to which an application
has been submitted for authorisation to practise as a lawyer from an EU
citizen already admitted to practise the profession in his country of origin
— to assess to what extent the knowledge and qualifications certified by
the diploma obtained by the person concerned in his Country of origin

121
A. PAOLETTI

correspond to those required in the regulations of the host State. Only if there
is only a partial match between those diplomas, are the national authorities
in question entitled to require the person concerned to prove that they
have acquired the knowledge and qualifications which are lacking (/réne
Viassopoulou v Ministerium fur Justiz, Bundes- und Europaangelegenheiten
Baden-Wiirttemberg, case C-340/89).

As regards exceptions to the rules on freedom of establishment, refer
to para. 1.5 for identity of essence.

2.3.2. Freedom of establishment of legal persons

As regarded as legal persons, Art. 54, paragraph 2, TFEU, specifies
that freedom of establishment applies to all ‘companies’, as defined by the
Treaty itself.

Article 54
2. ‘Companies or firms’ means companies or firms constituted
under civil or commercial law, including cooperative societies,
and other legal persons governed by public or private law, save
for those which are non-profit-making.

Furthermore, in order for the freedom of establishment to apply, the
following conditions need to occur: (i) the company has to be incorporated
under the laws of a Member State; and (zi) its registered office or central
administration or principal place of business has to be located within the
European Union.

With regard to legal persons, freedom of primary establishment is
embodied in the possibility of transferring their headquarters to another
Member State. In this regard it is necessary to point out that, at present,
European legislation leaves it up to each Member State to identify what
the connecting factor is for a company to be regarded as incorporated.
More precisely, at international-privatistic level there are two criteria on
the basis of which to determine which is the law applicable to a company
(so-called societatis lex): (i) that of incorporation (/ncorporation doctrine)
and (iz) that of the real headquarters (Real Seat doctrine).

According to the first theory, the /ex societatis applicable is that of the
State in which the company was incorporated (without detecting any
transfers of headquarters) while, according to the “Real Seat doctrine”, the

[22
FREEDOM TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND FREEDOM OF ESTABLISHMENT

law of the State in which the administrative headquarters of the company
is located is applied.

In the light of the above, the European Court of Justice stated that a
Member State has the power to define both the connecting factor required
of a company in order to be considered as incorporated under the law of
that Member State and that required in order to be able subsequently to
maintain that status. The above-mentioned power includes the possibility
for that Member State not to permit a company governed by its law to
maintain that status if the company decides to move its seat to the territory
of another Member State, breaking the connecting factor required under
the national law of the Member State of incorporation (The Queen, case
C-81/87, par. 19; Oktaté Cartesio és Szolgdltatébt, case C-210/06, par. 110).
Otherwise, the right of a company to transfer its registered office to another
Member State, with a change as regards the national law applicable, where the
company is converted into a form of company which is governed by the law
of the Member State, falls within the scope of application of Articles 49 et seq.,
TFEU (and therefore protected). Any imposition by the State of destination
of compulsory dissolution of the company and its reconstitution is, in fact,
contrary to freedom of establishment. In other words, companies are free to
become companies under the law of another Member State to the extent to
which it is allowed by that law.

Furthermore, the European Court of Justice has given wide recognition to
freedom of establishment on a secondary basis, recognising the right of companies to open branches in other Member States even when the branch is carrying
out the entire activity in the Member State of destination as its sole purpose.

According to the European Court of Justice, in fact, the decision to
incorporate a company in the Member State in which the rules of company law
are less strict, and subsequently create branches through which to carry out the
entire economic activity in other Member States, may not in itself constitute an
abuse of the right of establishment (Centros Ltd, case C-212/97).

Moreover, the right of establishment covers cross-border merger operations.
Indeed, according to the European Court of Justice it is contrary to freedom of
establishment to refuse to register in the commercial register a merger between a
company established in that State and one established in another Member State
(Systems AG, case C-411/03, para. 30).

123
A. PAOLETTI

3. Freedom to provide services and freedom of establishment: secondary legislation
3.1. Services Directive (Directive No. 2006/123/EC)

Turning now to the secondary legislation, we see that the rules on the
movement of independent activities (performed both through the establishment
of the economic operator and on a temporary and occasional basis, as happens
in the freedom to provide services) are covered by a specific rule in Directive No.
2006/123/EC (also known as the “Bolkestein Directive’ from the name of the
internal Commissioner rapporteur of the first draft).

The need for such regulatory intervention, as is apparent from recital 6 of
the Services Directive, arise from the consideration that direct application of
Articles 56 TFEU et seq. (freedom to provide services) and 49 TFEU et seq.
(freedom of establishment) does not allow full realisation of those two freedoms.

Recital no. 6

Those barriers [to the freedom of establishment for providers
in Member States and barriers to the free movement of
services as between Member States] cannot be removed
solely by relying on direct application of Articles 43 and 49
of the Treaty, since, on the one hand, addressing them on a
case-by case basis through infringement procedures against
the Member States concerned would, especially following
enlargement, be extremely complicated for national and
Community institutions, and, on the other hand, the lifting
of many barriers requires prior coordination of national
legal schemes, including the setting up of administrative
cooperation. As the European Parliament and the Council
have recognised, a Community legislative instrument makes
it possible to achieve a genuine internal market for services.

Hence the need to proceed with targeted action in order to give
effectiveness to the provisions of the Treaty and, at the same time, the goal
set by the European Council in Lisbon on 23 and 24 March 2000, namely
making the European Union the economy based on the most competitive
and dynamic knowledge in the world by 2010, with more and better jobs.

The definition of ‘provision of services’ and ‘establishment’ refers to the

definitions used by the Treaty.

124
FREEDOM TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND FREEDOM OF ESTABLISHMENT

According to Article 2, para. 2, the Services Directive does not apply,
inter alia, to the following activities: non-economic services of general
interest (letter a); financial services (letter b); electronic communications
services and networks (letter c); services in the field of transport (letter d);
healthcare services (letter f); gambling activities (letter h); private security
services (letter k); services provided by notaries and bailiffs (letter 1).
Moreover, the above-mentioned Directive does not apply even to the field
of taxation (Art. 2, para. 3).

On the other hand, the following, imter alia, fall within the scope of
the Services Directive: management consultancy, certification and testing;
facilities management, including office maintenance; legal or fiscal advice; real
estate services, such as estate agencies; construction, including the services of
architects; distributive trades; the organisation of trade fairs; car rental; travel

agencies; as well as services in the field of tourism, including tour guides,
leisure services, sports centres and amusement parks (Recital No. 33).

3.1.1. Essence of the Services Directive

The measures adopted by the Services Directive relate in particular to:
(i) administrative simplification (chapter II); (i) freedom of establishment
(chapter III); (zz) free movement of services (chapter IV); (tv) quality of
services (chapter V); (v) administrative cooperation (chapter VI).

In particular, European legislation assumes that one of the major
difficulties encountered by companies exercising an economic activity
in another Member State comes from the complexity, length and legal
uncertainty of administrative procedures.

Recital 43
One of the fundamental difficulties faced, in particular by
SMEs, in accessing service activities and exercising them is
the complexity, length and legal uncertainty of administrative
procedures.

To this end, the Services Directive, on the one hand, requires Member
States to check whether the procedures for exercising a service activity are
sufficiently simple and, if not, to simplify them (Art. 5, para. 1) and, on
the other, imposes specific obligations on them.

More specifically, the aforementioned Directive obliges Member States,
inter alia, to (1) accept certificates, attestations or any other document proving
that a requirement has been satisfied, issued by another Member State which
serves an equivalent purpose or from which it is clear that the requirement in
question has been satisfied (Art. 5, para. 3); (ii) set up points of single contact
at which providers can complete all formalities and procedures for carrying
out their activities (Art. 6); (zit) receive all the necessary information in a clear
manner (Art. 7); (tv) enable the completion of administrative procedures and
formalities at a distance and by electronic means (Art. 8).

With reference to freedom of establishment, the Services Directive
provides that Member States may subordinate access to and exercise of an
economic activity to an authorisation scheme only if z) the authorisation
scheme does not discriminate against the provider (Art. 9, para 1, letter a));
ii) the need for an authorisation scheme is justified by an overriding reason
in the public interest (Art. 9, para 1, letter 4)).; (47) the objective pursued

126
FREEDOM TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND FREEDOM OF ESTABLISHMENT

cannot be attained by means of a less restrictive measure, in particular
because an a posteriori inspection would take place too late to be genuinely
effective (Art. 9, para 1, letter c)).

The procedures for granting authorisation must also be characterised
by clarity, made public in advance (Art. 13, para. 1) and not have the
effect of unduly delaying provision of the service (Art. 13, para. 2).

Furthermore, the authorisation requested should not in any case
duplicate controls to which the provider is already subject in another
Member State (Art. 10).

With regard to the freedom to provide services, the provision which
is relevant is Art. 16, according to which the Member States must respect
the right of providers to provide a service in a Member State other than
that in which they are established (Art. 16, para. 1).

In particular, Member States may not restrict the free movement of
services by imposing on the provider, inter alia, the obligation of being
established on their territory (Art. 16, para. 2, letter z)); the obligation
of obtaining authorisation from the competent authorities, except where
provided for by the Services Directive or other instruments of European
law (Art. 16, para. 2, letter 4); a ban on the provider setting up a certain
form or type of infrastructure on their territory (Art. 16, para. 2, letter
c)); an obligation on the provider to possess an identity document issued
by their competent authorities specific to the exercise of a service activity
(Art. 16, para. 2, letter ¢)).

Restrictions on freedom to provide services are possible when there are
grounds of public policy, public security, public health or environmental
protection and, in any case, in compliance with the principles of nondiscrimination, necessity and proportionality (Art. 16, para. 3).

Moreover, the Services Directive provides for a series of measures designed
to promote the quality of services. These measures consist first of all in the
obligation of providers to provide recipients of the service with a range of
information, such as, for example, the name of the provider, his legal status
and form (Art. 22, letter z)); any clauses and conditions used by the provider
(Art. 22, letter f)); the existence of an after-sales guarantee, not imposed by
law (Art. 22, letter 4)); the main features of the service (Art. 22, letter 7)).

Furthermore, Member States are required to adopt accompanying
measures designed to ensure the quality of services on a voluntary basis.

127
A. PAOLETTI

Article 26
Policy on quality of services

1. Member States shall, in cooperation with the Commission,
take accompanying measures to encourage providers to take
action on a voluntary basis in order to ensure the quality
of service provision, in particular through use of one of
the following methods: (a) certification or assessment of
their activities by independent or accredited bodies; (b)
drawing up their own quality charter or participation in
quality charters or labels drawn up by professional bodies at
Community level.

[...]

Finally, as regards administrative cooperation, the Services Directive
also stipulates that Member States have an obligation of cooperation and
mutual assistance in order to ensure the supervision of providers and their
services (Art. 28). This assistance is embodied, in particular, in the right
of a State to request information, inspections or investigations of another
Member State and, conversely, the obligation of the latter to satisfy the
request received without delay.

An alert mechanism is also provided for whereby a Member State must
promptly inform the Commission and the other Member States concerned
of any behaviour of a service provider which could cause serious damage to
the environment, health or safety of persons (Art. 32).

3.1.2. Special legislation

Under Art. 3, para. 1, where an activity is subject to a specific rule, the
latter will prevail over the rule of the Services Directive. By way of example,
the Directive itself recalls (z) the Directive concerning the posting of workers
in the framework of the provision of services (Directive 96/71/EC); (zi)
the Regulation on the application of social security schemes to employed
persons and their families moving within the Community (Regulation EEC
No 1408/71); (zzz) the Directive on the coordination of certain provisions
laid down by Law, Regulation or Administrative Action in Member States
concerning the provision of audiovisual media services (Directive 2010/13/
EU); (iv) the Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications

(Directive 2005/36/EC).

1. Historical overview

At the origin of the European Union, the stability of economic and
monetary policy of the Member States were subject to the capital and
payments movements controlled by Member States.

The movement of capital and payments was not liberalized together
with the other three fundamental freedoms.

The original EEC provisions on capital and payments movements
appeared to be more prudent and less imperative than the other three
freedoms, since they were drafted in a more cautious way that the other
freedoms, providing that restrictions on free capital flows would only be
removed through positive integration and to the extent necessary for the
common market.

The original provisions of the freedom of capital movements lacked
direct effect, but with the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty the
original EEC rules have been amended and replaced and the movement
of capital and payments became a directly applicable freedom.

The free movement of capital and payments has been considered crucial
for the building of the Internal Market, empowering the growth of integrated
and competitive financial market and services in the European Union.

135
I. Ricci

Although the free movement of capital and payments has been developed
later than the other fundamental freedoms, currently it appears to be a relevant
and powerful freedom, broadly explored by the EC] case law.

The free movement of capital and payments covers today both discriminatory
and non-discriminatory restrictions and it is the sole freedom which can apply
to intra-Union as well extva-Union restrictions.

Actually the free movement of capital and payments has the broadest
scope of all TFEU freedoms, also covering the relationships between Member
States and third countries.

The level of liberalization of the freedom of capital and payments
movements, especially with reference to ivtra-Union transactions, is clearly
intended to grow forward, so that the scope of this freedom is deemed to be
further strengthened, also by means of the relevant case law to be developed

by the EC].
1.1 Evolution of the Free Movement of Capital

The original provision concerning the freedom of capital movement
was contained in Art. 67 EEC which provided that member States, in
the course of the transitional period and to the extent necessary for the
proper functioning of the Common Market, had to progressively abolish
as between themselves restrictions on the movement of capital belonging
to persons resident in Member States and any discrimination based on the
nationality or place of residence of the parties or on the place where such
capital is invested, while current payments connected with movements of
capital between Member States had to be freed from all restrictions not
later than at the end of the first stage.

According to Art. 68 EEC, Member States were required to be as liberal
as possible in granting exchange authorizations.

Furthermore, the original Art. 71 EEC pointed out that Member States had
to endeavour to avoid introducing within the Community any new exchange
restrictions which could affect the movement of capital and current payments
connected with such movement, and making existing rules more restrictive.

In this background, a specific role was played by the Council and the
Commission.

The Council, as provided by Art. 69 EEC, had the power to issue
Directives for the implementation of Art. 67, acting by a qualified majority
from the beginning of the third stage (i.e. January 1, 1996).

With reference to capital movements between Member States and

136
FREE MOVEMENT OF CAPITAL AND PAYMENTS

third countries, as set in Art. 70 EEC, the Commission had to propose
to the Council measures for the progressive coordination of the exchange
rate policies of the Member State, while, according to Art. 72 EEC, the
Member States had to keep the Commission informed of any known
movement of capital to and from third countries.

Finally, Art. 73 EEC enabled the Commission to authorise a Member
State to take protective measures in the event of movement of capital leading
to disturbances in the functioning of the capital market.

The ECC provided also protection clauses under the second paragraph
of Art. 71 EEC, and under Art. 108 EEC and Art. 109 EEC, in order to
promote a certain moderate degree of liberalization of the movement of
capital and payments.

Notwithstanding that, the provisions of the EEC concerning movement
of capital and payment soon turned out to be too vague and less ‘mandatory’
compared to the other three fundamental freedoms.

The conditional commitments meant that the original provisions of
the EEC about movement of capital and payments did not have direct
effect, not being able to give rise to rights enforceable by individuals
before their national courts.

In the lack of direct effects, the positive integration of the free movement
of capital and payments relied on legislative implementation.

To this aim, the Council adopted Directives on the basis of Art. 69
EEC, provided that the first paragraph of Art. 67 EEC did not abolish
restriction on the movement of capital by the end of the transitional period.

The first Council Directive was enacted on May 11, 1960, soon
amended by Directive 63/21/CEE.

According to the recitals of these Directives, the relevant legislative bedrock was not found entirely under Art. 67 EEC and Art. 69 EEC but also
under the second paragraph of former Art. 106 EEC, on current payments.

The above-mentioned Directives divided all movement of capital into
four lists A, B, C and D, annexed to the Directives, each of them with a
different degree of liberalization.

With reference to transactions or transfers mentioned in list A (including,
inter alia, direct investments in an undertaking in another Member State,
investment in real estate, some personal capital movements, short and
medium-term credits related to commercial transactions or provisions of
services, death duties and damages concerning the capital), Member State
had to grant ‘all foreign exchange authorizations, while in respect of the
movements covered by list B (such as transactions in securities, acquisition

137
I. Ricci

and liquidation by non-residents of domestic listed securities or by resident
of foreign listed securities) Member State had to grant ‘general permission’.
In the case of movement covered by list C (including the issue and placing
of a foreign undertaking on the domestic capital market, cross-border
acquisitions and liquidations of units in unit trusts) Member States were
required to maintain or reimpose exchange restrictions in the event that free
movement of capital would have formed an obstacle to the achievement of
its economic policy objectives. Finally, movements set out in List D (such
as physical importation and exportation of financial assets, including bank
notes, opening and placing of funds on current or deposit accounts) did not
have to be liberalized.

The mentioned legal context was modified by Directive 86/566, which
merged the list A and B of Directive 63/21/CEE into a new list A together
with certain movements from the old list C (such as the issue and placing of
securities of a domestic undertaking on a foreign capital market, granting and
repayment of long-term credits and cross-border acquisitions and liquidation
of units in unit trusts), while list C was renamed list B and still subject to the
possibility for Member State to maintain or reintroduce exchange restrictions
effective as of the date of the entry into force of the Directive itself, in the event
that free movement of capital could be an obstacle for the relevant Member
State to achieve its economic policy objectives. Lastly, the old list D became
list C, but not yet liberalized.

In this legal framework, the absence of direct effect of the provision
concerning the movement of capital was confirmed by the case law of the EC].

In its fundament case Casati (case 203/80), in 1981, the ECJ rejected the
direct effect of the original provisions of the free movement of capital, ruling
that complete freedom of movement of capital might undermine the economic
policy of one of the Member State or create an imbalance in its balance of
payment, thereby impairing the proper functioning of the common market.
For these reasons, the ECJ pointed out that Art. 67(1) EEC was different
from the provisions on the other three fundamental freedoms since there was
an obligation to liberalize capital movements only ‘to the extent necessary to
ensure the proper functioning of the common market’.

According to the ECJ in the Casati case, Art. 67 EEC did not require
to simply abolish restrictions on the movement of capital, since the scope
and the restriction might vary in time and depend on ‘an assessment of
the requirements of the common market’ and ‘on an appraisal of both the
advantages and risks which liberalization could entail for the latter’, also
taking into account the level of integration attained in matters in respect

138
FREE MOVEMENT OF CAPITAL AND PAYMENTS

of which capital movements are ‘particularly significant’.

The EC] also pointed out that such an assessment was a matter for the
Council and that the obligation to abolish restrictions on movement of
capital could not be separated from the Council’s assessment of the necessity
to liberalize such transactions.

The EC] therefore concluded that Art. 67 EEC was not a provision which
a national court and even the ECJ could apply directly, but a question of policy
of the Council, which the EC] was just required to examine in order to verify
whether the Council had overstepped the limits provided by the same rule.

It is from the second half of the eighties that the liberalization of
the capital movements became a priority for the creation of the Internal
Market, as mentioned in the White Paper from the Commission to the
European Council dated 28-29 June 1985 (COM 310/1985) and in the
Programme for the liberalization of capital movements in the Community
dated 23 May 1986 (COM 86/292), which enshrined the principal
actions to put in place in this matter.

The most important legislative measure of this early period was Directive
88/361 enacted for the implementation of Art. 67 EEC, which established
the full liberalization of capital movements within the European Union with
effect, for most Member States, from July 1, 1990.

Art. 1(1) of Directive 88/361 expressly provided that Member States were
required to abolish restrictions on movements of capital taking place between
person resident in Member State. In order to facilitate the application of such
provision, the Directive provided with a nomenclature in the Annex.

Directive 88/361 stated that Member State had to abolish restrictions
on movements of capital taking place between persons resident in Member
States. To facilitate the application of such Directive, capital movements had
to be classified in accordance with the annexed nomenclature. Furthermore,
according to the same Directive, in order to achieve the liberalization of capital movements, it was required the abolition of foreign exchange restrictions
and the removal of all obstacles to the execution of the capital transactions.
As a consequence, the Directive gave access to the financial system of any
Member State to individuals and financial service firms.

The erga omnes effects of the provision under Art. 1 of Directive
88/361 were confirmed by Art. 7 of the same Directive, which, also if not
in imperative terms, provided that in the treatment of transfers in respect
of movements of capital to or from third countries, the Member States
shall endeavour to attain the same degree of liberalization as that which
applies to operations with residents of other Member State.

The Directive 88/361 was the basis of the process of liberalization of
financial services.

In 1992 the Maastricht Treaty replaced the old provisions on free
movement of capital and payment by adopting a new set of rules.

In a single chapter, the Maastricht Treaty brought together the provisions on capital, amended to reproduce the content of Directive 88/361,
and the provisions on payments.

This legislative action turned the provisions on free movement of capital
and payments from being a weak freedom to be a strong freedom both within
and outside the European Union.

The provisions governing the freedom of movement of capital are currently contained in Art. 63, 64, 65 and 66 within Chapter 4 of Title IV (‘Free
Movement of Persons, Services and Capital’) of the TFEU.

In detail, current Art. 63(1) TFUE - (which was Article 73b(1) EEC,
the Maastricht Treaty number, renumbered at Amsterdam as Art. 56(1)
EEC and at Lisbon as Art. 63(1) TFUE) - provides that:

Art. 63 TFUE
1. Within the framework of the provisions set out in this
Chapter, all restrictions on the movement of capital between
Member States and between Member States and _ third
countries shall be prohibited.

1.2 Evolution of the Free Movement of Payments

As per the provisions concerning the free movement of capital, also
the provisions concerning the free movement of payments were original
drafted in prudent terms.

The wording of Art. 106 EEC, contained in Title I (Economic
Policy), Chapter 2 (Balance of Payment) provided that each Member
State had to undertake to authorise, in the currency of the Member State
in which the creditor or the beneficiary resides, any payments connected
with the exchange of goods, services or capital, and also any transfers of
capital and wages, to the extent that the movement of goods, services,
capital and persons was freed as between Member State.

Such a provision required Member States to authorize means of payment
as consideration for trade in goods, persons, services or capital.

140
FREE MOVEMENT OF CAPITAL AND PAYMENTS

The interpretation of the provisions on free movement of payments
was also developed by means of the case law of the EC].

In case Thompson (case 7/78), the ECJ pointed out that Art. 106(1)
EEC was one of the most important provision in the original version of
the EEC for the purpose of achieving a common market.

In the leading case Luisi and Carbone (case 286/82 and 26/83), the
EC) ruled that Art. 106(1) EEC was directly effective, giving rise to rights
enforceable by individuals before their national courts, at a time when the
EEC provisions on free movement of capital were not directly effective.

In the Luisi and Carbone case it appeared that there was a clear distinction
between movement of capital and current payments, even though the mentioned Directives on free movement of capital enacted under the original Art.
67 EEC seemed to have considered both types of transactions.

In the case ED Srl (case 412/97), the ECJ pointed out that the provision
on payments was intended ‘to enable a person liable to pay a sum of money
in the context of a supply of goods or services to discharge that contractual
obligation voluntarily without undue restriction and to enable the creditor
freely to receive such a payment’.

With the decision in the Lambert case (case 308/86), the ECJ clarified
the distinction between Art. 106(1)EEC and Art. 67 EEC.

The EC] pointed that Art. 106 covered current payments (z.e.: transfers of
foreign exchange being the consideration within the context of an underlying
transaction of goods, persons, services or capital), while Art. 67 ECC covered
movements of capital (z.e.: financial operations essentially concerned with the
investments of funds, rather than with consideration for a service).

The provisions governing the freedom of movement of payments, such
as those concerning the freedom of movement of capital, are currently
contained in Art. 63, 64, 65 and 66 within Chapter 4 of Title IV (‘Free
Movement of Persons, Services and Capital’) of the TFEU.

In detail, current Article 63(2) TFUE, replacing Art. 106 EEC, provides
that:

Art. 63 TFUE
[...]

1. Within the framework of the provisions set out in this
Chapter, all restrictions on payments between Member
States and third countries shall be prohibited.

141

2. Definitions and scope
2.1 Definition of ‘Capital and ‘Payments

The TFEU does not contain a definition of ‘capital’ or ‘payment’.

Legislative definitions were specified in the above-mentioned annex to
Directive 88/361, which contained a nomenclature of capital movements
which the EC] has accepted as of an ‘indicative value’ for the purposes of
defining the notion of capital movements, as it did before the entry into
force of Art. 63 TFUE.

In the case Trummer and Meyer (Case 222/97) the ECJ stated that, since Art.
63 TFEU substantially reproduces contents of Art. 1 of Directive 88/361, and
even though that Directive was adopted on the basis of Art. 69 and Art. 80(1)
EEC, which have been then replaced by Art. 63 TFEU, the nomenclature in
respect of movement of capital annexed to Directive 88/361 still has the same
indicative value, subject to the qualification contained in the introduction to
the nomenclature, since the list set out therein is not exhaustive.

In the Trummer and Meyer case the EC] pointed out that mortgages
was a transaction covered by the nomenclature and so was ‘inextricably
linked to a capital movement’.

The ECJ also stated that investments in real property, its administration
and its sale constituted a movement of capital.

A capital movement is also considered to be a ‘direct investment’ in a
company by means of a shareholding with the view of effectively participating
in the management and control of a company as ruled by the EC] in one of the
Golden shares cases (case 367/98, Commission v. Portugal).

It is possible to consider as movements of capital also inheritances,
banknotes and coins, gifts in money or in kind, guarantees granted by
non-residents to residents or by residents to non-residents, and granting
of credit on a commercial basis.

In the case Verkooijen (case 35/98) the EC] ruled that the receipt of
dividends from a foreign company, although not listed in the mentioned
annex, fell within the scope of the Treaty since it was linked to some of the
measures in the annex.

Therefore, even if not listed in the annex, a transaction could still constitute a capital movement within the meaning of Art. 63(1) TFEU.

The notion of capital within the European Union is therefore able to go
beyond the broad categories listed in the Directive 88/362, being even able
to extensively expand its scope.

142
FREE MOVEMENT OF CAPITAL AND PAYMENTS

2.2 Territorial scope

In spite of the original Art. 67 EEC and Art. 1 of Directive 88/361, the
current provision of Art. 63 TFUE takes into consideration the territorial
presence of the capitals instead of the nationality of the persons or their residence
within the European Union, being a condition to have a link between the
movement of capital and (at list) a Member State.

This entails that also a person resident in another Member State could
take advantage of such a freedom, as long as the relevant capitals are
located in the territory of a Member State.

More in detail, with respect to inter-state movement, in order to apply
Art. 63(1) TFEU, there must be a movement of capital between Member
State, but the rule is not always self-evident.

In the Block case (case 67/08) the EC] considered to be an inter-state
movement and therefore applied Art. 63(1) TFEU to the situation of an
inheritance being located both in Germany and Spain.

Furthermore, Art. 63 TFEU applies also to movement of capital
between member State and third countries.

This extension of the rights of free movement of capital and payment
to third countries goes beyond all the other fundamental freedoms.

The extension of the territorial scope of the free movement of capital
contributes to the principle of an open market economy pursuant to Art.

119 TFEU.
2.3 Direct effect of Art. 63 TFEU

In the above-mentioned Casati case (case 203/80) the ECJ ruled that
Art. 67 EEC was not directly effective, considering that the provisions on
free movement of capital were not yet liberalized at that time.

With the case Sanz de Lera (joined cases 163/94 and 250/94) the EC]
ruled that Art. 73 (b1) EEC, now Art. 63(1) TFEU, was directly effective.

Accordingly, the ECJ, in the A case (case 101/05) ruled that Art. 63(1)
TFEU ‘lays down a clear and unconditional prohibition for which no
implementing measure is needed and which confers rights on individuals
which they can rely on before the courts’.

As confirmed by the case law of the ECJ, Art. 63 TFEU is therefore
vertically directly effective.

In spite of that, the question whether Art. 63 TFEU might have hori
143
I. Ricci

zontal direct effect seems to be not yet solved, even though the position of
the EC] in the case Volkswagen (case 112/05) appears to be contrary to the
attribution of horizontal direct effect to Art. 63 TFEU.

The EC] also clarified that Art. 63 TFEU is directly effective with
regard to capital movements between Member State and third countries.

In the Sanz de Lera case the EC] pointed out that the expression
‘within the framework of the provisions set out in this Chapter’ contained
in Art. 63 TFEU relates to the whole chapter in which it appears. The
provisions should therefore be interpreted in that context. The EC] also
stated that the exception in Art. 64(1) TFEU concerning the application to
non-member countries of the restrictions existing on 31 December 1993
under national law or Union law regarding the capital movements listed in it
to or from non-member countries is ‘precisely worded’, with the result that no
latitude is granted to the Member States or to the Union legislature regarding
either the date of applicability of the restrictions or the categories of capital
movements which may be subject to restrictions. Furthermore, according to
the ECJ, the power to adopt measures granted to the Council by Art. 64(2)
TFEU of the Treaty relates only to the categories of capital movements to
or from non-member countries listed in that provision. The EC] also ruled
that the adoption of such measures is not a prerequisite for implementing the
prohibition laid down in Art. 63(1) TFEU, ‘since that provision relates to
restrictions that do not come within the scope’ of Art. 64(1) TFEU.

The ECJ therefore ruled that Art. 63 TFEU conferred directly
enforceable right on individuals with reference to capital movements both
between Member States that between Member States and third countries.

3. Prohibition of Discriminatory and Non-Discriminatory National Rules

The original provision of Art. 67 EEC provided for the abolition ‘of all
restrictions on the movement of capital’ and ‘any discrimination based on
the nationality or on the place of residence of the parties or on the place
where such capital is invested’.

The current wording of Art. 63(1) TFEU does not contain any reference
to ‘discrimination’, since the Maastricht Treaty amended Art. 67 EEC
removing the reference to ‘discrimination’ and referring solely to ‘restrictions’.

Notwithstanding that, according to the legislative field of application
of the other three freedoms, it seems that Art. 63(1) TFEU prohibits

144
FREE MOVEMENT OF CAPITAL AND PAYMENTS

national measures being both directly and indirectly discriminatory as well
as non-discriminatory measures which are capable to be an obstacle to the
free access to the market.

This interpretation seems to be in line with the provision on free movement of services which prohibits discriminations on all the same grounds (Z.e::
on the grounds of nationality, place of residence of the parties and place where
capital are invested).

Accordingly, in its decisions the ECJ took into consideration both the
discrimination approach and the restrictions approach, in order to remove
measures interfering with the free movement of capital, even though
deciding on the basis of the current wording of Art. 63(1) TFEU.

The EC] confirmed that Art. 63 TFEU could cover non-discriminatory
capital restrictions.

Moreover, according to the ECJ case law, Art. 63 TFEU may apply
both to direct and indirect discriminations.

With reference to direct discriminations, in the Sandoz case (case
439/97) the ECJ ruled that the imposition of a stamp duty on loans by
the national Austrian legislation was likely to deter national residents from
obtaining loans from persons established in other Member State, being
considered a restriction to capital movements under Art. 63 TFEU.

In Golden Share cases (see, inter alia, cases 367/98, 483/99, 503/99) the ECJ
confirmed that Art. 63 TFEU deals also with non-discriminatory measures.

In brief, such cases concerned the possibility for Member State to influence, in various manner, shareholder structures and corporate decisions by
means of national legislation.

These cases arose in context where many European States had decided
to re-privatise formerly nationalised companies providing public services.
In order not to lose influence on those companies, national governments
tried to maintain a certain degree of control over them by limiting the
transfers of shares to certain investors or by issuing ‘golden shares’.

More in detail, in the case Commission v. France (case 483/99), the
EC] had to decide upon a national decree allowing the French government
to secure influence over a national company by means of the issuing of
a golden share. National provisions required the prior approval from the
domestic government when a person, acting alone or in conjunction with
others, exceeded a fixed part of the capital or of voting rights in a company.

In the case Commission v. Belgium (case 503-99) the EC] had to solve a
dispute concerning the possibility for the Belgian government, according to
its domestic legislation, to preclude investors from carrying out transactions

145
I. Ricci

in certain domestic companies active in the energy sectors, in case the relevant
Minister would have considered that such operations could adversely affect
domestic interests in the energy sector.

In the case Commission v. Portugal (case 367/98), national rules precluded
investors from buying more than a given number of shares in certain privatized
Portuguese companies operating in specific sensitive sectors.

Moreover, in the case Commission v. Portugal, Portugal claimed that
national legislation on the matter was a non-discriminatory measure that fell
outside current Art. 63 TFEU, but even so the ECJ ruled that it had to be
considered a restriction of the free movement of capital. In detail, the EC]
specified that even though ‘the rules in issue may not give rise to unequal
treatment, they are liable to impede the acquisition of shares in the undertakings concerned and to dissuade investors in other Member States from
investing in the capital of those undertakings. They are therefore liable, as a
result, to render the free movement of capital illusory. In those circumstances the rules in issue must be regarded as a restriction on the movement of
capital within the meaning of Art. 73b of the Treaty. It is therefore necessary
to consider whether, and on what basis, that restriction may be justified’.

Therefore in these three cases the ECJ ruled that, also taking into
consideration Directive 88/361 and the nomenclature annexed to it, the
disputed regulations fell under the scope of the movement of capital and
payments according to Art. 53(1) of the EEC. In accordance with the
above-mentioned annex, capital movements included direct investments
involving the control and administration of a company.

The EC] then ruled that the disputed domestic provisions involved
unequal treatment of nationals of other Member States and restricted the
freedom of movement of capital.

With reference to possible impairments of the freedom of establishment
under Art. 43 EEC by the mentioned domestic legislation, in the mentioned
Golden Share cases the ECJ considered that, in the cases of Portugal and
France, restrictions on the freedom of establishment are direct consequence
of the obstacles to the movement of capital and that, in the case of Belgium,
as for restrictions on the movement of capital, it is possible to justify possible
restrictions to the freedom of establishment.

In the Golden Share cases of 2003, Commission v. United Kingdom
(case 98/01) and Commission v. Spain (case 463/00), the ECJ, following
the case Alpine Investments (case 384/93), ruled that non-discriminatory
measures which hinder access to the market breached Art. 63(1) TFEU
unless they could be justified.

146
FREE MOVEMENT OF CAPITAL AND PAYMENTS

The mentioned case Commission v. United Kingdom concerned the 1986
‘Airport Act’ that privatised the British Airport Authority and permitted the
Secretary of State for Transport to retain a special share allowing its owner
to block certain business decisions within such company.

In such a case, the EC] stated that Art. 63 TFEU would go ‘beyond
the mere elimination of unequal treatment, on grounds of nationality, as
between operators on the financial markets’ and pointed out that although
national rules limiting the acquisition of shareholdings over a certain level
applied without distinction to both residents and non-residents, ‘it must
nonetheless be held that they affect the position of a person acquiring
a shareholding as such and are this liable to deter investors from other
Member States from making such investments and, consequently, affect
access to the market’.

The EC] had therefore ruled that the government’s golden share was
to be considered a restriction on the free movement of capital.

The ECJ has also ruled cases on possible indirect discriminatory
national rules, even though such decisions are rarer than those on possible
direct discriminatory national provisions.

In the case Hollman (case 443/06), the EC] found to be an unjustified
breach of Art. 63(1) TFEU the Portuguese national law which imposed to
non-residents a higher rate of capital gains tax than residents, that being
considered an indirect discriminatory national legislation.

4. Restrictions on the Free Movement of Capitals and Payments
4.1 Third-Country Restrictions (grandfathered provisions)

The free movement of capital and payments between Member State
and third countries is subject to potential restrictions both provided by the
TFEU or established by the case law of the ECJ and based on exceptions
contained in the TFEU.

The most important restriction to the free movement of capital and
payments is the ‘grandfathered restrictions’, provided by Art. 64(1) TFEU.

It allows Member State to continue to apply restrictions which existed
with regard to third countries involving direct investment, including in real
estate establishment, the provisions of financial services or the admission of
securities to capital markets (but not payments) in force on 31 December

147
I. Ricci

1993 (or, in case of Bulgaria, Estonia and Hungary, on 31 December 1999).
4.2 Other Third-Country Restrictions

Specific restrictions are provided by TFEU with reference to movements
of capital and payments to and from third countries.

Another restriction is provided by Art. 64(2) TFEU, stating that:

Art. 64 TFUE
[...]

1. Whilst endeavouring to achieve the objective of free
movement of capital between Member State and third
countries to the greatest extent possible and without
prejudice to the other Chapter of the Treaties, the European
Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the
ordinary legislative procedure, shall adopt the measures on
the movement of capital to or from third countries involving
direct investment — including investment in real estate —
establishment, the provision of financial services or the
admission of securities to capital market.

Furthermore, Art. 64(3) TFEU allows the Council, acting unanimously
in accordance with the special legislative procedure, and after consulting
the Parliament, to adopt measures which ‘constitute a step backwards in
Union law as regards the liberalization of the movement of capital from
or to third countries’.

The Lisbon Treaty added a relevant important provision under Art.

65(4) TFEU providing that:

Art. 65 TFUE
[...]

In the absence of measures pursuant to Article 64(3), the
Commission or, in the absence of a Commission decision
within three months from the request of the Member
State concerned, the Council, may adopt a decision stating
that restrictive tax measures adopted by a Member State
concerning one or more third countries are to be considered
compatible with the Treaties in so far as they are justified by

148
FREE MOVEMENT OF CAPITAL AND PAYMENTS

one of the objectives of the Union and compatible with the
proper functioning of the internal market. The Council shall
act unanimously on application by a Member State.

[ase]

The above-mentioned provision could be considered unusual, since it allows
the Council, and not the EC], to rule on the legality of national measures.

Other restrictions concerning transaction to and from third-countries
are provided by Art. 66 TFEU and concerns balance of payment.

It allows the Council to take safeguard measures for up to six months,
where ‘in exceptional circumstances, movements of capital to or from
third countries cause, or threaten to cause, serious difficulties for the
operation of economic and monetary union’.

4.3 Tax Restrictions

Many cases under Art. 63 TFEU concern national measures on direct
taxation.

The cases focused on the question whether the taxation rule constituted
a restriction on free movement; more recently the cases are discussed on a
discrimination-base analysis and the EC] describes any such discriminatory
treatment as a restriction on the free movement of capital which is, in
principle, forbidden by Art. 63(1) TFEU.

In the Sandoz case (439/97) the ECJ applied a restriction-based
approach with respect to tax rules.

The case concerned the Austrian national rules providing that, where
a natural or legal person resident in Austria entered into an agreement
outside Austria for a loan not set down in a written instrument and the
existence of the loan was recorded by an entry in the borrowers’ book of
and record account, he was liable to pay a stamp duty.

The EC] found that provision to be discriminatory according to the
place where the loan was contracted and stated that discrimination of that
nature was likely to deter residents from contracting loans with persons
established in other Member States.

According to the ECJ such national provisions constituted a restriction
to the principle of the free movement of capital within the meaning of Art.
73b(1) TFEU.

The ECJ decisions also concerned the question whether a dual fiscal

149
I. Ricci

burden through double taxation violated or not the Internal Market and
in particular Art. 63 TFEU, considering that double taxation exists where
two countries claim tax sovereignty over a cross-border situation.

In the case Verkooijen (case 35/98), a Dutch employee of a Belgian
company claimed that the company shares he received as part of an
employee's saving plan were both subject to dividend tax in Belgium and
to income tax in the Netherland, despite the fact that the Dutch rules
excepted dividends received from Dutch companies from income tax. He
therefore pointed out that the limitation of the income tax exemption to
national companies violated the free movement of capital.

The ECJ ruled that such legislative provision had the effect of dissuading
nationals of a Member State from investing their capital in companies having
their seat in another Member State. According to the EC] such a provision had
a restrictive effect as regards companies established in other Member States.

Also in the case Test Claimants (IT) (case 35/11) the ECJ ruled that since
European Union law ‘as it currently stands does not lay down any general
criteria for the attribution of areas of competence between the Member
State in relation to the elimination of double taxation within the European
Union’, each Member State remains free to organise its system for taxing
distributed profits, provided, however, that the system in question does not
entail discrimination prohibited by the TFEU.

In its decisions, the EC] adopted an international model based on the
fiscal sovereignty of the Member State.

In this context, Member States are only prevented from adopting
domestic discriminatory measures, since a direct tax may violate Art. 63
TFEU in case it offers a less favourable treatment in foreign capital.

Therefore, any Member State can apply its tax system to capital being
within its jurisdiction, but it has to maintain a neutral and coherent
domestic tax system.

4.4 Prudential Restrictions

Moreover, certain prudential measures are provided by Art. 65(1b),
stating that:

Art. 65 TFUE

1. The provisions of Article 63 shall be without prejudice to
the rights of Member States:

150
FREE MOVEMENT OF CAPITAL AND PAYMENTS

[...]

(b) to take all requisite measures to prevent infringements
of national law and regulations, in particular in the field
of taxation and the prudential supervision of financial
institutions, or to lay down procedures for the declaration
of capital movements for purposes of administrative or
statistical information, or to take measures which are justified
on the grounds of public policy or public security.

[...]

These measures must not represent a means of arbitrary discrimination
or a distinguished restriction in the meaning of Art. 65(3) TFEU.

In this context, the ECJ ruled that the difficulty in blocking capital once
it has entered a member State may justify various treatment of transactions
involving foreign direct investment.

In the case Eglise de Scientologie (case 54/99), the EC] had to decide
whether Article 73d(1)(b) of the Treaty, which provides that Article 73b
thereof is without prejudice to the right of Member States to take any
measures which are justified on the grounds of public policy or public
security, permits national legislation to require prior authorisation for
direct foreign investments which are such as to represent a threat to public
policy or public security.

The EC] clarified that the provision of national law which submits a
direct foreign investment to prior authorisation constitutes a restriction
on the movement of capital within the meaning of Article 73b(1) TFEU,
but that the question arsing was whether Article 73d(1)(b) of the Treaty
(which provides that Article 73(b) thereof is without prejudice to the right
of Member States to take any measures which are justified on grounds of
public policy or public security) permits national legislation to require
prior authorisation for direct foreign investments which are such as to
represent a threat to public policy or public security.

To this aim the ECJ firstly stated that while Member States are still, in
principle, free to determine the requirements of public policy and public
security in the light of their national needs, those grounds must, in the
Community context and, in particular, as derogations from the fundamental
principle of free movement of capital, be interpreted strictly, so that their
scope cannot be determined unilaterally by each Member State without any
control by the Community institutions. Thus, according to the ECJ, public
policy and public security may be relied on only if there is a genuine and

151
I. Ricci

sufficiently serious threat to a fundamental interest of society (see, to this
effect, the Rutili case). Secondly, the EC] pointed out that measures which
restrict the free movement of capital may be justified on public-policy and
public-security grounds only if they are necessary for the protection of the
interests which they are intended to guarantee and only in so far as those
objectives cannot be attained by less restrictive measures.

The ECJ also expressed that, in case of direct foreign investments, the
difficulty in identifying and blocking capital once it has entered a Member
State may make it necessary to prevent, at the outset, transactions which
would adversely affect public policy or public security. It follows that,
in the case of direct foreign investments which constitute a genuine and
sufficiently serious threat to public policy and public security, a system
of prior declaration may prove to be inadequate to counter such a threat.

In this case, however, the essence of the system in question is that prior
authorisation is required for every direct foreign investment which is ‘such
as to represent a threat to public policy [and] public security, without
any more detailed definition’. Thus, the investors concerned are given
no indication whatever as to these specific circumstances in which prior
authorisation is required.

The EC] clarified that such lack of precision does not enable individuals
to be apprised of the extent of their rights and obligations deriving from
Art. 73(b) TFEU. The ECJ therefore ruled that “The answer to the question
submitted must therefore be that Article 73d(1)(b) of the Treaty must
be interpreted as precluding a system of prior authorisation for direct
foreign investments which confines itself to defining in general terms the
affected investments as being investments that are such as to represent a
threat to public policy and public security, with the result that the persons
concerned are unable to ascertain the specific circumstances in which
prior authorisation is required.’

That being so, the system established seems to be contrary to the principle of legal certainty.

4.5 Public Security Restrictions

Restrictive measures may be taken by Member States also pursuant to
Art. 52(1) TFEU, which allows Member States to take restrictive measures
if justified by public policy or public security reasons.

The EC] clarified that exceptions to the fundamental principles of
the TFEU must be allowed narrowly and in a suitable, proportionate and

152
FREE MOVEMENT OF CAPITAL AND PAYMENTS

transparent way, subject to judicial review, as decided in the case Eglise de
Scientologie (case 54/99).

In the case Albore (case 423/98) the ECJ ruled that the requirements
of public security cannot justify derogation from the TFEU rules such as
the freedom of capital movements unless the principle of proportionality
is observed, which means that any derogation must remain within the
limits of what is appropriate and necessary to achieve the aim in view and
must not go beyond what is necessary to secure the objective.

The EC] also expressed that under Article 73d(3) of the EEC Treaty
the requirement of public security may not be relied on to justify measures
constituting a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction
on the free movement of capital.

In that regard, according to the EC], a mere reference to the requirements
of defence of the national territory of the Member State concerned does
not fall within the scope of Article 224 of the EEC. It cannot be therefore
sufficient to justify discrimination on grounds of nationality against nationals
of other Member States regarding access to immovable property on all or part
of the national territory of the first State. The Court ruled that the position
would be different only if it were demonstrated, for each area to which the
restriction applies, that non-discriminatory treatment of the nationals of all
the Member States would substantially expose the military interests of the
Member State concerned to real, specific and serious risks which could not be
countered by less restrictive procedures.

Moreover, with reference to third countries, in case A (case 101/05), the
ECJ declared that the extent to which the Member States are authorised
to apply certain restrictive measures on the movement of capital cannot be
determined without taking account of the fact that movements of capital to
or from third countries take place in different legal contexts from that which
occurs within the Community, but the third country has to demonstrate
that a restriction on the movement of capital to or from third countries is
justified for a particular reason in circumstances where the reason would
not constitute a valid justification for a restriction on capital movements
between Member State.

By means of the same decision, the EC] acknowledged that the
liberalisation of the movement of capital with third countries may pursue
objectives other than that of establishing the internal market. However, it
stated that the Member States enshrined the principle of free movement of
capital in the same article of the EEC and in the same terms for movements
of capital taking place within the Community and those relating to relations

153
I. Ricci

with third countries, whilst at the same time providing safeguard clauses and
derogations which apply specifically to the movement of capital to or from
third countries.

In addition, Art. 75 TFUE, as redrafted after Lisbon Treaty, allows the
European Parliament and Council to define a framework for administrative
measures, aimed at preventing and combating terrorism and related activities,
concerning capital or payments, such as freezing of funds, financial assets or
economic gains belonging to, or owned or held by, natural or legal persons,
groups or non-State entities.

4.6 Other Restrictions established by the EC] Case Law

The EC] has pointed out that the free movement of capital and payment
may be substantially restricted only by national rules justified by reasons
related to Art. 65(1) TFEU or by ‘overriding requirements of the general
interest’ and which are applicable to all persons and undertakings pursuing
an activity in the territory of the host member State. Furthermore, ‘in order
to be so justified, the national legislation must be suitable for securing the
objective which it pursues and must not go beyond what is necessary in order
to attain it, so as to accord with the principle of proportionality’ (case 367/98,
Commission v. Portugal).

The EC] case law has considered to be important and prevalent interests
those concerning services and supplies of general interests, such as the postal
service in the case Commission v. the Netherlands (joined cases 282/04 and
283/04), or the public telecommunications network service in the case
Radiosistemi (case 429/00), or services in the energy sector, as in the case
Commission v. Spain (case 463/00).

Other justifications have been found in the measures aimed to protect
national values, as broadly considered. In the case Commission v. Austria
(case 10/10), the ECJ recognised that the promotion of research and
development could constitute a public interest requirement.

The ECJ also ruled that public interest requirements may be found in
the protection of interest of third parties. In the case VBV (case 39/11) the
EC] recognised ‘the need to guarantee the stability and security of the assets
administrated by an undertaking for collective investment created by a
severance fund, in particular by the adoption of prudential rules’ as a public
interest requirements.

Since there is not a fixed definition of general interest requirements in

the TFEU, the list is intended to be widely expanded by the ECJ case law.

FREE MOVEMENT OF CAPITAL AND PAYMENTS

5. Free movement of Capital and Payments and the other fundamental
Freedoms

The TFEU considers the possibility of overlap between the freedom of
capital movement and the other fundamental freedoms.

With reference with the freedom of establishment, Art. 49 TFEU provides that the freedom of establishment is ‘subject to the provisions of the
Chapter relating to capital’, while the provisions on capital ‘shall be without
prejudice to the applicability of restrictions on the right of establishment
which are compatible with the Treaties’.

The EC]J seems to prefer not to apply both the freedom simultaneously.

As a matter of example, when the EC] manages a case in which the
investors has gained ‘definitive influence’ in the foreign company, the
freedom of establishment applies and the exam of the freedom of capital
movement is no more necessary (case 196/04, Cadbury Schweppes).

Furthermore, where a national restriction concerns ‘ordinary shareholder’, the EC] ruled that free movement of capital will apply and that
there is no need for a separate examination of the measures at issue in the
light of the Treaty rules concerning freedom of establishment’, where the
establishment restriction was ‘a direct consequence of the obstacles to the
free movement of capital’ to which it is ‘inextricably linked’ (case 367/98,
Commission v. Portugal).

In the event of cases concerning intra-Union capital movements, the
EC] has recognised the possibility to have a parallel application of both
the freedoms. When, instead, a third-country restriction is concerned,
only the free movement of capital should be apply (as in case 35/11, Test
Claimants (I1)).

The ECJ explained this external limitation of Art. 63 TFEU in the
mentioned case Test Claimants (Il)), where it stated that ‘since the Treaty
does not extend freedom of establishment to third countries, it is important
to ensure that the interpretation of Article 63(1) TFEU as regards relations
with third countries does not enable economic operators who do not fall
within the limits of the territorial scope of freedom of establishment to
profit from that freedom’.

The relation between free movement of capital and payments and
free movement of service is instead contained in Art. 58(2) TFEU, which
provides that

Art. 58 TFUE

1. The liberalization of banking and insurance services
connected with movement of capital is to be effected in step
with the liberalization of movement of capital.

[...]

The EC] used to apply the Treaty provisions on services together with
those on capital.

Most recently, the EC] seems to prefer to examine the ‘centre of gravity’
of the national rules and then applies either the provisions on services or
those on capital, as the case may be (case 452/04, Fidium Finanz).

In the mentioned Fidium Finanz case, the ECJ ruled that ‘contrary to the
chapter of the Treaty concerning the free movement of capital, the chapter
regulating the freedom to provide services does not contain any provision
which enables service providers in no-member countries and established
outside the European Union to rely on those provisions’. Thus, according
to the ECJ, the question concerned ‘the delimitation of and the relationship
between, first, the Treaty provisions concerning the freedom to provide services
and, second, those governing the free movement of capital’. Where a national
measure relates to the freedom to provide services and the free movement of
capital at the same time, it is necessary to consider to what extent the exercise
of those fundamental liberties is affected and whether, in the circumstances of
the main proceedings, one of those prevails over the other’.

The EC] also pointed out that it will examine ‘the measure in dispute in
relation to only one of those two freedoms if it appears, in the circumstances
of the case, that one of them is entirely secondary in relation to the other
and may be considered together with it’.

In the Fidium Finanz case, using the centre-of-gravity approach, the
EC] found that the freedom of services was predominant and the restrictions on capital were a consequence of the restrictions imposed on the
provisions of services.

The free movement of capital and payment, by means of the relevant
case law to be developed by the EC], is therefore still adjusting its scope,
especially with respect to its relationships with other freedoms.

Abstract

Chapter 5 — The free movement of capital and payments has been very
important for the building of the Internal Market, empowering the growth of an
integrated and competitive financial market and services in the European Union.

Even thought it was not liberalized together with the other three fundamental freedoms, the free movement of capital and payments is currently a relevant
freedom, covering both discriminatory and non-discriminatory restrictions.

It is the sole freedom which can apply to intra-Union as well extra-Union
restrictions and it covers also the relationships between Member States and
third countries.

The scope and the level of liberalization of the freedom of capital and
payments movements, especially with reference to intra-Union transactions, is
intended to be further strengthened, also by means of the relevant case law to
be developed by the EC].
